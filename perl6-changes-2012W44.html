<title>Perl 6 changes - 2012W44... sorta</title>
<meta http-equiv=Refresh content="0; url=/perl-6-changes-2012W44.html">
<p>The Perl 6 changes for 2012W44 URL has been changed (because I've
   forgot a dash). Because it was already linked in Gabor Szabo's Perl
   Weekly, I've decided to put this redirect page. It looks like your
   browser doesn't support <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> redirect, so you
   have to click <a href="/perl-6-changes-2012W44.html">redirect URL
   manually</a>.
