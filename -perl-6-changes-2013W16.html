<title>Perl 6 changes - 2013W16... sorta</title>
<meta http-equiv=Refresh content="0; url=/perl-6-changes-2013W44.html">
<p>The Perl 6 changes for 2013W16 URL has been changed (because I had
   dash at beginning of file name by accident). Because it was alread
   linked in Gabor Szabo's Perl Weekly, I've decided to put this
   redirect page. It looks like your browser doesn't support <code>
   &lt;meta&gt;</code> redirect, so you have to click <a href=
   "/perl-6-changes-2013W16.html">redirect URL manually</a>.
