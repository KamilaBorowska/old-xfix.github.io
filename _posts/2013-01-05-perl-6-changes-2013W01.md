title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W01
---
I have finally updated the number before 'W'. Well, we have the new
year - 2013. And because of that I would like to say 'Happy new year!'.

This is yet another article in "Perl 6 changes". I lately don't put
articles other than those, but I don't have many ideas for those,
really.

By the way, I find it interesting that no new posts on Planet Six
appeared between my previous Perl 6 changes article and current Perl 6
changes article.

### Incompatible changes
#### Rakudo Perl
* "SAFE" setting is now removed. You're supposed to use "RESTRICTED"
  setting now.

### New features
#### Rakudo Perl
* Using non-associative operators when association is needed throws
  typed error message.
* Compile time optimizations for `(|)` signature (accepting anything),
  It's worth handling because it's commonly used for `proto`s.
* Fixed typos in `X::Import::Redeclaration` error message.
* Removed old `perl6doc` documentation.
* `DateTime.Date` now works correctly.
* `.pick` now randomizes better on large ranges.

#### Niecza Perl
* `infix:<->(Instant, Instant)` now supported.
* Bitwise operations support big integers.
