title:  Perl 6 changes - 2012W51
---
TODO: Insert the description of changes. Also, mention that Rakudo
2012.12 (Warszawa) was released and that Rakudo isn't Rakudo Star.

### Incompatible changes
#### Rakudo Perl (in Rakudo 2012.12)
* When disambiguating hash/block, and `$_` variable is used, Rakudo
  assumes block. This could break your code if you were expecting
  a hash.

#### Rakudo Perl (post Rakudo 2012.12)
* `my $a; { $a; my $a }` is an error.
* `for` runs in sink (void) or list context, just like `map` (actually,
  `for` does exactly what `map` does). If you were depending on it, you
  can use `eager do` before `for` to force eager execution.

### New features
#### Rakudo Perl (in Rakudo 2012.12)
* Added `X::Comp::Group` exception. It's used when compilation
  can produce multiple issues.
* Added support for warnings. Code like `my ($a, $a);` only causes
  warnings, not fatal errors.
* Added `X::Undeclared::Symbols` exception for variables that weren't
  declared, but used.
* You can use `.message` on `Exception`s.
* Fixed `.perl` output for a `Pair` that has key that is a `Pair`.
* `X::Item` is thrown for `@a[NaN]` or `@a[Inf]`. It isn't incompatible
  change because it wasn't working before anyway.
