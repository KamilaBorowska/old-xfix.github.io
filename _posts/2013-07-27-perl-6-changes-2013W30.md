title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W30
---
This time, the Perl&nbsp;6 changes article comes more regularly
(Saturday, not Friday like previously).

### Potentially incompatible changes
#### Perl 6 specification
* [`utf8` is now `blob8`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/3a9c994782e6a94c87a37b396575babb9c0f1b66)

* [Removed `will start`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/683b532b43e0a7aafab852a71373503e3fc61de7)

  You have to use `once { ... }` now instead of `will start`.

#### Rakudo Perl
* [`Buf` is now a role.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/fa3ec0245c99fd17f11e216b8abb33b996d0b55e)

  Also, provided `buf8`, `buf16`, `buf32`, and `buf64` symbols.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* [`.encode` returns `Blob`s.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/3a9c994782e6a94c87a37b396575babb9c0f1b66)

* [Type objects work as Nil in non-scalar contexts.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/e45fc46ebda8e5549e668ffe6d5cba48fc359f65)

#### Rakudo Perl
* [Made `{@keys}:k` faster.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/45d4473b611c0db134a79919317386e38a549440)

* [Added `Blob` types.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6ab6d8d60acef9525db5be02b1e445e0172c9554)

* [Added standard method when calling object methods from `EnumMap` class itself.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c5d90d6bbddd247a4444f817f404e3a12071beb9)

      > EnumMap.Capture
      Parameter '' requires an instance, but a type object was passed

* [Changed `Parameter ''` in message above to `Invocant`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/819d371660ffb2343d411ae9fa3613243aa57eba)

* [When `ListIter.infinite` cannot decide whatever list is infinite or not, it returns `Nil`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9db2d5212e652be868144af438ec42fb173a6178)

* [When `sleep` goes to the future, the Rakudo says how far into the past you wanted to go.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6404e5245c39e5930baa74b0d5b39a980fe7c979)

  The time machine is still not implemented, and it's unlikely to be
  implemented in any Perl&nbsp;6 implementation, unless somebody would
  make a patch.

* [`Buf` concatenation is now faster.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/fbd875e71cd38c79c4c775fd13ad005264a4e329)

* [Made double method error better.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/1822009f50b0f519b5bc7b0f2a29c143981dc8bc)

* [Added unsigned integer types.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/fefe2e4213c62ad6e37c1e545d1715ba69a9def1)

  They are like standard integer types, except using `uint` instead
  of `int`, for example the C unsigned integer is `uint32` (assuming
  that C integer is 32-bit, which is standard on many platforms).

* [Added `Stringy` method to `Str` and `Blob`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/4550293f038e9948f22108fede41352ad49741fe)

* [`.list`, `.flat`, `.eager`, and `.hash` are aware of type object.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d12ecc5c8bbcdd97936738cbf0156c5f37f69b3f)

  When called on type object, they return empty list/hash.

* [Type objects appear as `Nil` in non-scalar contexts.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c3a58f998dd21535d986a8a42003c11fe7266f78)

      > my Hash @a

      > say @a[42].elems
      0

* [`for` loops in sink context are actually sunk.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/49404ef959b75106e04700c78005f41e1eaf6b78)

* [`Real ~~ Real.item` works.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/117beb2d0021c46f129bc0bef93f4b41f4e0ec1d)

* [Added `is readonly` and `is rw` traits for variables.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c428a378f86988d0d0785a83f6763673a8f75eb7)

  `is readonly` is default for subroutine arguments, `is rw` is default
  for `my` variables.

* [Added `of TypeObject` trait.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c73fd26a13144bd89176fa6080ecae69f31fa1c8)

* [Added stubs for `will` trait.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f4b2ce47d9bead932483e5310b54c75db6ce7462)

* [Removed `is context` trait.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/624a6e7a373d8c80775f91fc8e19ffb01821d03)

  Considering it was never implemented to begin with, it shouldn't be
  incompatible.

* [Made `Buf.eqv` faster.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/35818f885be581e339cc2bf382bd66dda6f57dd1)

* [Rakudo doesn't complain when exporting the same symbol twice.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/1f1076a2facc612b67af7adfe6def5e41c8a94c0)

* [Added `X::Comp::Trait` exception.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0d3c78cf4b963d9f324c757813b37cff03fa48a1)
