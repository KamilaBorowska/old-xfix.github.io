title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W33
---
This time, the update is relatively small, and mostly involves dynamic
variables (the reason why update was small, is probably that many people
were on [YAPC::Europe 2013](http://act.yapc.eu/ye2013/)).

### Most likely not incompatible changes, but in some cases incompatible
#### Rakudo Perl
* [`CALLER` doesn't allow you to access non-dynamic variables.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/99993eed6239e14bbf28cf6a815e95bd978e7dcc)

  Also, implemented `is dynamic` trait (so it isn't noop anymore).

### New features
#### Rakudo Perl
* [`is default(42)` works for hashes and arrays.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/948210e9e49b5aa2e60642d3ecd0b11bf047dbe8)

  It lets you specify default variable in hashes and arrays, when you
  try to access element that doesn't exist.

      $ perl6 -e 'my %hash is default<perfect>; say %hash<elem>'
      perfect

* [`if` interpreted as function call now throws typed exception.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9bbec9cb019cd55ba081b0f14df619bd70c3afab)

* [Increased thread limit in Rakudo for JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d14fd44190d506295f70f4cebc296cb8eb670820)

* [`make install` compiles Rakudo when not compiled.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d9f8d6e6fc3cfd22460508407100cbbc31063f4f)

* [It's possible to read `nqp::build-date` configuration variable.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3aebcac81cb5fd7124ddff7dad0f468bacc6c4a0)
