title:  Perl 6 changes - 2012W39
---
Rakudo Perl 6 still wasn't released, but likely it will be released
soon - currently it isn't released because of bug in Parrot causing
every line while reading files to be got when requesting one - using
older Parrot version is considered too. If you're waiting for Rakudo
2012.09 release, just be patient. Anyways, let's mention Perl 6 changes
for that week.

I'm aware that changes aren't really impressive, but hey - not every
week is impressive. And today it's more important to make Rakudo Perl
work for delayed 2012.09 release than add lots of new features.

### Incompatible changes
#### Rakudo Perl
* Setting encodings on sockets temponarily removed.

### New features
#### Rakudo Perl
* `eqv` now avoids undef warnings.
* `Signature` now supports `~~` operator.
* `&trait_mod:<is>.onlystar eqv True`
* More native types usage in code to improve performance.
* `my (:$a, :$b) := foo()` now works.
* `is hidden` trait and `hides` is implemented.
* `:60[23, 59, 59]` is now supported - this syntax allows for arbiarily
  high bases (higher than 36).
* Perl 5 regexpes support captures.

#### Niecza
* `expmod` works on big integers.
