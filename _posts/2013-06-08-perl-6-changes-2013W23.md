title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W23
---
The JVM support of Rakudo Perl is mostly usable now (it's still very
buggy, but you can run "Hello, world!"). The instructions to install
Rakudo on JVM are available in [README file](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6495a5cb042816c0fb98a7b82440387de7a1fa09).

### Incompatible changes]
#### Perl 6 specification
* [Removed `tcuc`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/d1f9930373d9aa92dd24df24212cb3cbd74f4de6)

  Forcing the first character to titlecase, and rest of the characters
  to uppercase wasn't the most useful thing. It was rather pointless.
  If you really deal with Unicode edge cases, use `.uc.tc` instead.

#### Rakudo Perl
* [`.lines` when limit is specified, doesn't eat too much.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9cf3a88b607a838ee2cedbb621c8f343d5f832b0)

  It's incompatible if you depended on previous invalid behavior, and
  after reading the lines you read lines again.
  
#### Niecza Perl
* [Removed `tcuc`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/b8f846e59b436bd0e66bc4887cede3ce404f73f1)

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* [Added `Str.IO` and `Str.Path`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/2f8ec122eb664450fa30f8c3c624539187fcc600)

* [Added some more adverbial combinations.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/b6ca88efd8689423b7485b11b03b0cfb6f5c0498)

  The added combinations involve `:delete`, `:exists`, and `:p` or
  `:kv` negated or not.

#### STD.pm6
* [`%{}` doesn't warn in declaration.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/2504c1ad139bf35826753ebff769aab1c9209558)

* [Use of Perl&nbsp;5 `\N{NAME}` shows a warning.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/ea24a2907dc4b5c696dccc0c47ea13512ac12457)

  In Perl 6, this is `\c[NAME]`.
  
* [Feeds are statement separators.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/b29e94035483e9277ee43baa7f6ff500a2181d36)

* [Multiple return parameters are allowed.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/6348f35d2f6abe6ad84f610b0c429cbb361f53d9)
  
#### Rakudo Perl
* [Modules are loading faster.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0020ef749f43201b5ab48b050a70b47df5d6a564)

  Rakudo Perl now doesn't check every option, but shortcircuits.

* [Fixed autoviv Typed hash problem.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0f88d34e302133235270a07c42b9bb667d743e3d)

* [`.exists` works with typed hashes.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/99c82d37321198d296cea321b8877deb52f13a23)

* [`dir()` is now lazy.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9557da29eb8e6b9fe94b3a5129e2c0e8e955cd2e)

  This shouldn't cause problems, as unlike languages like Python,
  in Perl&nsbp;6 generators are just arrays with magic - you can even
  index them.
  
* [`:delete` is supported with `:kv`, `:p`, `:k`, and `:v` adverbs.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/12b13e5254a366dd6e3950d26c7a0abb24b5f929)

* [`List.gist` doesn't warn on undefined values.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b2072f578c04bbf7ac4d4b684ffdff42a2b2a29a)

* [Added basic JVM build instructions.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6495a5cb042816c0fb98a7b82440387de7a1fa09)

* [`$/` and `$!` is now seen inside eval/REPL.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c38c659528588cdafa1e1fb212f098cb763966ed)

* [Moved `IO::Handle.copy` to `IO::Path.copy`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f737ff7bb095f81ef1c28664fe77b72979436766)

  Copying isn't file handle operation. As such, it doesn't fit in
  `IO::Handle`. The old implementation still exists, but it's
  deprecated and shows warning.
  
* [Implemented every valid adverb combination.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d690ac6e39d81a84469510f84b7c1434779fd225)

* [`?^` returns `False` instead of `Nil` on `0`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0dceace6747e86d036a5bbbe7f5a3c4effb61f5e)

#### Niecza Perl
* [Added `%*CUSTOM_LIB` to make panda happy.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/67d20f18241021c22d7249d109ad21a225898ae1)

* [Contents of `%*CUSTOM_LIB` are in `@*INC`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/88ee1d83a12a38f0366ef61ec6eebe090a2a58eb)

  Not that `@*INC` works to begin with, but it still contains
  information that could be potentially helpful.
  
* [Added `Str.path`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/7c7c2ffa19619a0f5704de0d024e1b1c990e9b34)

* [Added support for `%*ENV<PERL6LIB>`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/ae1f8dc5404f0afa394e88ee5cf91295138dfa23)

* [Added `IO::FileTestable` and `IO::Path`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/95dde43c73ba5132e458b2e9bfab0be91a2abf78)

* [`dir` returns `IO::Path` instance.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/1bed6b7a8a7e965e9d3db16b07ac6ee4bd476719)

* [Added `.Set`, `.KeySet`, `.Bag`, and `.KeyBag`](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/eaf57ce7e618fa37c78f018f735bee3c5dcc8df3)

  These methods can be used for casting.
