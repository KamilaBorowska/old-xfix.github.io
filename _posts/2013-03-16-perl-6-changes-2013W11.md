title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W11
---
I would put nothing here, but the layout of blog would make this look
ugly. So, well, like usually I put something here, even if it is
meaningless. Just look below to see list of changes.

### New features
#### Rakudo Perl
* Closing brace, followed by newline and infix operator was
  parsed incorrectly. For example, following code.

      my %a;
      { }
      %a<b> = 1;

  Was parsed like:

      my %a;
      { } % a()<b> = 1;

  Instead of correct.

      my %a;
      { };
      %a<b> = 1;

* Done more `pir::` to `nqp::` replacements in order to help JVM
  port of Rakudo Perl.

* Case insensitive matches with strings now work.

      my $nonsense = 'asdf';
      say "OK" if "ADSF" ~~ m:i/$nonsense/;

* Typing `else if` and `elif` after `if` block shows "Please use
  'elsif'" error message.

* `&?ROUTINE` variable is available inside `regex foo { ... }`.

* The named params are optimized in compile time when possible.

* `X::Method::NotFound` is raised even when dealing with `""` (empty)
  method names.

* Fixed proto of `infix:<ne>` in order to require `Mu` objects.

* `Stash.at_key` method now works.

* Postcircumfix calls can be cached now.

* `LEAVE` is now fired on `next`/`last` in `MapIter`.

* Exception is thrown when `Range` endpoint is used to create a Range.

#### Niecza Perl
* `Empty.gist` returns nothing.
