title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W42
---

Rakudo Perl 2013.10 "Roederbergweg" was released. All changes (well,
just one, again) are already in. I think this is my shortest article
yet, but that's most likely because most of Rakudo Perl changes were
about writing release announcement. I'm not going to include them,
because it happens every month, doesn't it?

New features
============

Rakudo Perl
-----------

* [Implemented NativeCall for JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/e22ac2aa6df8375dccc41462325af4c9960134ab)

  The support is mostly basic, but it works, as long you aren't using
  more complex structures, like arrays.

Perl 6 specification
--------------------

* [Updated dictionary to mention that `&` is a sigil.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/75b2e71f33183e04659533e47fdc8ee2b4b205aa)

  `&`, just like in Perl 5 is used for code (technically subroutines,
  but the definition in Perl 6 is loosened to anything you can call)
  variables.
