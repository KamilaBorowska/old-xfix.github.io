title:  Perl 6 changes - 2012W46
---
So, well, now that my code compiles (well, C code, not Perl 6 code :-))
I've time to describe Perl 6 changes, instead of simply doing what
[XKCD says] - I shouldn't waste time.

Rakudo Perl 2012.11 is now released. The change mentioned in this
article is already in.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* `NativeCall` module is now part of specification.
* Calls to `trait_mod` routines are evaluated in sink context.

#### STD.pm6
* `-->` (return type) acts more like a normal subroutine parameter.

#### Rakudo Perl
* `:($a, $b) := \(1, 2)` updates `$a` and `$b` instead of doing
  nothing.
