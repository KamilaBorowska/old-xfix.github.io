title:  Perl 6 changes - 2012W45
---
It's another late Perl 6 changes article. Today the fun parts are
adverbs, adverbs and adverbs. Oh, and blocks. And fixing bugs. Have
fun playing with new features.

### New features
#### Rakudo Perl
* `INIT {}` block is now rvalue.
* `our ($x, $y)` works correctly.
* `take` and `take-rw` have correct return values.
* `SET_FILE_LINE` is now called only on exceptions that support it.
* `FIRST`, `NEXT` and `LAST` blocks are supported on various kinds of
  loops, previously it only worked for `for` loops.
* Implemented operator adverbs.
* Associative objects now support `:exists` and `:delete` adverbs.
* `q:c[]` (string with interpolated closures) now works.
* Implemented slice adverbs, such as `:p`, `:kv`, `:k` or `:v`.
