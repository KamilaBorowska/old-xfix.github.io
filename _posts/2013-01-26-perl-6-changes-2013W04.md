title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W04
---
Today, the main features is `.delta` method in `DateTime` and `Date`.
And as usually, bug fixes that make language do what you mean.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* Added `DateTime.delta` and `Date.delta` to the specification.

#### Rakudo Perl
* `s///` resets `$/` on failure.
* `s///` returns `False` on failure.
* Regular expressions allow `$()` syntax for arbitrary expressions.
* Socket functions work better with non-ASCII characters.
* Errors about function only taking positional arguments now specify
  name of function that was called.
* `DateTime.truncated-to` now takes `TimeUnit` enum as argument.
* Implemented `DateTime.delta` and `Date.delta`.
* Names are suggested for `--> Type` (subroutine return type).
* `/< hello >/` now works correctly (matching `hello`), just like
  `/< hello world >/` already did.
