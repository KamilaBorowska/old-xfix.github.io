title:  Perl 6 changes - 2012W46
---
I'm already aware that my blog looks spammy because of all those Perl 6
changes posts. I would like to remove all that garbage, so I'm thinking
about separate site for those posts (of course with proper redirects of
my old URLs).

### Deprecations
#### Rakudo Perl
* In Rakudo Perl 2012.12, `&foo` when `sub foo` isn't declared will
  make CHECK-time exception instead of returning `Nil`.

### New features
#### STD.pm6
* When `<infix><prefix><space>` sequence appears, user gets warning.
  This helps avoiding code like `$a ~~~ $b` which actually means
  `$a ~~ (~$b)`.
* Empty infix operator (`sub infix:[""]`) isn't allowed anymore.

#### Rakudo Perl
* BOM (Byte Order Mark) at beginning of file is ignored.
* `--optimize` isn't passed by default to Parrot when `--parrot-option`
  is specified.

#### Niecza Perl
* Niecza doesn't depend on global `Top` variable anymore allowing
  multiple Niecza interpreters running at once. It was being removed
  for two months.
