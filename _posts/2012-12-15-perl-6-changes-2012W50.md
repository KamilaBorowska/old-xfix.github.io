title:  Perl 6 changes - 2012W50
---
So, this is yet another article in Perl 6 Changes series. (I know,
those introductions are really boring, but would you like to see Lorem
Ipsum Dolor instead)? As in previous week, Rakudo mainly improves
Perl 6 parsing.

By the way, if you don't know about [Perl 6 Coding Contest], check it
out. The challenges are rather easy if you had any programming language
experience (if you don't know Perl 6, check out [Using Perl 6] book).
If you still have questions, people in [#perl6] can help you.

### Incompatible changes
#### Rakudo Perl
* `uniq` has `===` semantics. It could break your programs if you for
  example were using `uniq` to remove identical arrays (previously they
  were converted to strings which did what you wanted, as long the
  strings in array didn't contained space or you didn't have array in
  array.

### New features
#### Rakudo Perl
* "Two terms in a row" error message.
* Information about what was expected, if possible.

      $ perl6 -e '2 2'
      ===SORRY!===
      Two terms in a row
      at -e:1
      ------> 2 ‚èè2
          expecting any of:
              postfix
              infix or meta-infix
              infix stopper
              statement end
              statement modifier
              statement modifier loop

* `for 1..10 { say so 9999 == any(1..2000) }` is 30 times faster
  (huge junctions are faster).
* Added Texas versions of the Set and Bag operators, used in
  [Bags and Sets] article in Perl 6 Advent Calendar.
* Rakudo Perl now informs about obsolete use of `.` to concatenate
  strings.
* Implemented `sub term:<foo>`. Now `2 + 2 == 5` can be true for
  sufficiently huge values of 2 (not like it should be).
* `qww` now works.

#### Niecza Perl
* `slurp` now works without arguments.
