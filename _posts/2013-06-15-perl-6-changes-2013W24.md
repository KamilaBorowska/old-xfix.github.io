title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W24
---
This week is full of potentially incompatible changes. Excluding
`first` change I've mentioned before, they are rather minor. Still,
they could break code depending on them.

### Incomatible changes
#### Rakudo Perl
* [`first` returns `Nil` instead of failing in `first`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3f49bbd446192caf664d5633f906483a9817a03a)

  It could break code that depends on exceptions [See my older
  article about this](http://glitchmr.github.io/perl-6-changes-2013W21.html).
  
* [`.hash` is now a contextualizer.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/693af19379dae95fc94f96b697f390a1db67ee35)

  It never supposed to be a constructor, but it had `:type` (in this
  week, also a commit changing it to `:keytype` appeared, but was
  quickly removed because of this change), and `:of` arguments.
  They were removed now.
  
* [`.categorize` returns `Hash` instead of `Parcel` of `Pairs`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d4126784b1988ee94566bd4537874ff2d7700203)

  It's admitably more useful as `Hash`. While I marked it as
  incompatible change, it actually shouldn't affect much, considering
  that it was mostly cast to `Hash` just after using anyway.

#### Niecza Perl
* [Removed non-standard `.set` and `.bag`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/b15a1625d9d996c95b6c1a53c84507561a9b86e3)

  Those were non-standard. Instead, `.Set` and `.Bag` were added, to
  match other casting operators.
  
* [Also, removed obsolete `.to-set`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/3e65d845764eff7165fe58e1017743559c2d2bee)

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* [Documented `IO.copy`, `IO.rmdir`, and `IO.unlink`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/448160b9b846282d6b2d2e842599c9d5cf34737c)

  These work just like UNIX system calls, except are less lowlevel
  (fail, instead of simply returning error codes). The exception is
  `IO.copy` that also has `:$createonly` argument that causes it to
  fail when file already exists.

* [`dir` and methods documented above now soft fail.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/fce3dd9ae22f2ec4b9ca854cc6563f7b5af393b0)

  Because some may not understand, especially having experience with
  `or die` idiom from Perl 5 (this commit has a commit), I'm going to
  explain. The `fail` doesn't mean returning error code. It means
  returning special sort of value. If the value won't be specifically
  checked (the function is used sink context, or without boolean
  check), the object will explode.
  
  For example, following snippet of code will fail when file won't
  exist.

      unlink "file";

  But this won't, as I make boolean check.
  
      unlink "file" or $*ERR.say: "Oh noes.";

* [`try` implies `use fatal`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/58d18fa4f9cf45d45c3bc3949f5aa006b28eb4ff)

  Soft errors are considering fatal in `try` blocks.

* [`constant`s, `enum`s, and `our` variables are now exportable.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/8875a2490be493170c31ec4f97ef2bdec6d82899)

#### STD.pm6
* [Use of `undef` refers to `Any` instead of `Mu`.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/d4cc5abedf5d5c9c4d8f3a3f83f4352ced7c5a69)

#### Rakudo Perl
* [Implemented `:$<foo>` syntax in regexes.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d25808bd098772944f31b212f3e9789a92e37f8c)

* [Removed combination of `:exists` and `:k`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f415ec0a3577241c8f5f4c97fa92ceff397c0db6)

  Have I mentioned it previous week? Sorry, it was a printing error
  (assuming you can make a printing error on the web). It doesn't
  actually make sense. It was removed one day just after I made
  previous article.
  
* [Fixed error for `my &foo; multi foo() { }`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/75678776e776ca06e9f57a65565188abfeeb969d)

  Previously it returned "Method 'is_dispatcher' not found for invocant
  of class 'Any'". It was LTA (Less Than Awesome), and was corrected.
  
* [Comma operator is disallowed in reduce.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6b1a6710e6f92e5859b0c7408460a5b1124731e2)

  All it was causing were infinite loops for lists containing more than
  one element. As it was rather pointless, it's now disallowed. If you
  really want it, provide a code block.
  
* [`perl6 -v` returns version under Windows.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5075c3b5aa9531a939ec92730186aef87406440c)

  Previously, configuration script was calling
  `git describe --match '2*'`. The problem is that Windows doesn't
  support single quotes. It was changed to double quotes to avoid
  problems.

* [Converting `NaN` or `Inf` to `Rat` returns itself.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/a503510b1e6b4ac70b1476d3326f13389117f3c9)

  `NaN` is so magical that it actually ignores cast requests. The
  previous behavior of casting `NaN` to `0`, and erroring on `Inf` was
  just wrong.
  
* [`{}:kv`, `{}:p`, `{}:k`, and `{}:v` work just like in spec.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d4e9ae89611db210dd57b5402a5cd3af48eff0e8)

* [`$*CWD` and `$*TMPDIR` are now `IO::Path` objects.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/33c5e82f54434200dd6cb091f904d67a21338ec2)

* [`Hash[TVal,Tkey].new` works.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/90f3beeceb73cf731d4834aa82974a4c3f2f7516)

  `.new` now looks into `Hash` type constraints while making new
  `Hash`.

* [Use of `undef` refers to `Any` instead of `Mu`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5705c3d86a5e119dd2a7cc23e0f59e71a19cf3cd)

* [Hash shapes have better error messages.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/cdda38e9922b7881071ef668454848399060d353)

* [`$default` doesn't leak to `GLOBAL::`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/42ef7bec930bca97ec06b880b7d81ace2cc7c40a)

* [Implemented `Hash.classify`, and `Hash.categorize`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d3ae978e0fb4a24560feb96148d265b53a6f5a64)

* [Some list methods fail early on infinite list.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5b61bccb325e077ee3178eba4428732004762f1d)

  As stuff like picking random element from infinite list doesn't make
  sense, it makes sense to fail fast.

#### Niecza Perl
* [`new-from-pairs` doesn't issue warnings.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/6314dd4b2316541965b32524eb40b06d8ceee22d)

  `++` was issuing warning each time it met a new key, because it was
  adding to `Any` (undefined).

* [Added coercion operators for `Set`, `KeySet`, `Bag`, and `KeyBag`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/db4190b7b7d8b1183e57c4f6e2aaadab2c3b8d85)

  Niecza already had these for `Set`s and `Bag`s, but it was
  non-standard `.set` and `.bag`.

* [Also, types mentioned above got new `ACCEPTS`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/b8dd5160eda48c47f52ca6220af7c59ecf279df0)

  They check whatever they are equal.
  
* [`≼` and `≽` work with anything.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/480a062e569da62b58b7ae985795ee6f19aa57e2)

  When the arguments aren't `Bag`s, they are converted to them.
