Incompatible changes
====================

Rakudo Perl
-----------

* [`{}.delete` doesn't support multiple keys.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3e4d3e8baa13b57e5926365bbf1fc48d447645b4)

  They aren't in the specification. Code like `{}.delete(<a b c>)` is
  now invalid.

New features
============

Perl 6 specification

* [Added `∅` symbol for empty sets.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/8ece611462f2bb694dbaeee3e52713bf3b493242)

  It works exactly like `set()` or `set` (before `set` without
  parenthesis was removed).

* [`*` symbol used with postcircumfixes automatically sets correct type.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/26c204cfad070e097d16b8e496113add500c24c3)

  For example, `*[1]` gives `-> @a { @a[1] }`.

Rakudo Perl
-----------

* [Rakudo now panics when it cannot generate exception.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/20d5a68a061819b48e7c8fbb391423d658099722)

  Now it doesn't try to make exception about failing to make an
  exception, because this is fatal, not just error.

* [Errors about named parameters for object methods now mention object.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/dbc827353b9e14347c82c4b69ce32380e2c495e3)

* [JVM loads correct IO::Spec.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7cede9dc32782b01d4dfe8d45624f8f82737629c)

* [`substr-rw` now works in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f390e4177e55f3d80b79b35ab2c8efdafcbe6111)

  This is caused by the fix in `Proxy`.

* [Unsigned integers are available in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d50a0fca570b82054309078666aad594ceb7fcb6)

  You can now use native `uint` type, even while JVM doesn't support
  it.

* [`squish` with `:as` in Parrot works just like in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7e981ca47dba9d0640b5a83c26912501a44b9e13)

* [`Duration.Num` now actually returns `Num`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ddf3222f038577b22ed73ff8091ed50586540219)

* [`DEPRECATED` is now properly mentioned in list of possible traits.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c549b655efc6c4056e71ec686110c384b94dc3c2)

  The list of possible traits appears on unknown trait error.

* [Error in signature reporting doesn't cause entire error reporting to fail.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/575afc057a4dec2111a45f6bffc24f2cae7f1749)

* [`.exists` method suggests `:exists` adverb instead of internal `.exists_key` method.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/384a0fa76bdc35b9ec49fc914ac6c7cadbbc5b02)

* [Multiline comments now work in regular expressions.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9ed945dd6c0033506015b7f582bcbfbb2e9129b4)

  Code like the following now works.

      / something #`[] /

* [You can use empty sets using `∅` symbol.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/2813ce92764d4e3327982cb8e1e22a17c91cd16a)
