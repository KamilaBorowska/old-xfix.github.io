title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W22
---
This is relatively small, but big update. Small in term of number of
commits, big in terms of new features. `IO` methods already implemented
in implementations were added to specification. New array methods that
avoid flattening are now in Synopsis. New features to help with bitwise
operations, `msb` and `lsb` also were added - and implemented in
Perl&nbsp;6 implementation.

jnthn is working on new, lightweight virtual machine for Rakudo called
MoarVM, intended to be optimized for Perl&nbsp;6. It already supports
6model (as its core object system), Unicode strings, GC, IO, binary
bytecode, and more. You can [get more information about MoardVM at
jnthn's blog](http://6guts.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/moarvm-a-virtual-machine-for-nqp-and-rakudo/).

### Incompatible changes
#### Perl 6 specification
* [Changed `START` to `once`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/fca7f5a90384693468e8df4698fedb5e5995c78e)

  `START` wasn't a real phaser, because it was executing inline. As
  uppercase keywords are reserved for phasers that execute off-flow
  (for example, `CATCH` executes when exception happens in block where
  it's contained, or `BEGIN` that executes at beginning).
  
  Also, `START` was bad name for something that runs once.

#### STD.pm6
* [Changed `START` to `once`.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/6b4371ded8af2d0646af4f69a2a44552bd45d3df)

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* [Added `IO::Handle.encoding`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/415f998968a441cd2b58f85c0007814a5d7c05dd)

  This method can be used to determine current file encoding. It was
  already implemented for a long time in current specification, but
  just got a specification.
  
* [Added `IO::Handle.open`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/415f998968a441cd2b58f85c0007814a5d7c05dd)

  The method can be used for reopening filehandles, or reusing them
  for different files. It was also already implemented in
  implementations, so it makes sense to spec it.
  
* [Added `:r`, `:w`, and `:a` parameters to open.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/415f998968a441cd2b58f85c0007814a5d7c05dd)

  They stand for read, write, and append. Those already existed in
  implementations, and just like examples above, was added to
  specification.
  
* [Added `IO::Handle.IO`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/346540cbe029487bb05a9064776242fd5d19a1e3)

  Casts `IO::Handle` to `IO::Handle`. [It's actually useful, in certain
  cases](http://stackoverflow.com/q/11386398/736054).
  
* [Added `Int.msb` and `Int.lsb`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/4f0895bf8669b8a87d9b257172b89e736108f061)

  `msb` returns the position of most significant bit (generally
  log<sub>2</sub> of the number rounded down, but without
  [floating point issues](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2654175/736054)).
  `lsb` returns the position of least significant bit that is 1.
  
* [Added `.arg` and `.args` methods.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/9f5a96874c5addfa739323bbbd147e1d382256a8)

  By default, `.[]` and `.elems` flatten `Parcel`s.
  
      > ('first', ('second', 'third'), 'fourth')[2]
      third
      > ('first', ('second', 'third'), 'fourth').elems
      4

  Sometimes this behavior is unwated. In these cases you can use new
  methods, `.arg` and `.args`.

      > ('first', ('second', 'third'), 'fourth').arg(2)
      fourth
      > ('first', ('second', 'third'), 'fourth').args
      3

#### Rakudo Perl
* [`IO::Handle` now has `gist`, `perl`, `path`, and `IO` methods.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8a08591ec79e06d09c9a05946d7cdb473c574b45)

  `gist` shows plain text information about whatever filehandle is
  opened, and where if it is.
  
  `perl` converts file handle to Perl 6 code. It preserves file path,
  position, and `chomp` property.

  `path` works mostly like previous `$.path` property, except you
  cannot change it, and it is `IO::Path`, not `Str`.
  
* [Added `Int.msb`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8a08591ec79e06d09c9a05946d7cdb473c574b45)

* [Added `Int.lsb`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/cd5ca7c6d0074018dd4d0b6fb3a651ea66c94262)

### Niecza Perl
* [Added `Int.msb`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8a08591ec79e06d09c9a05946d7cdb473c574b45)

* [Added `Int.lsb`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/cd5ca7c6d0074018dd4d0b6fb3a651ea66c94262)
