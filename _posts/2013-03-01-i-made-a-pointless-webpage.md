title:  I made a pointless webpage
---
So, well, I have a VPS, and decided to put a webpage on it for lulz.
You can see it at http://mango.uk.to/, and the source (sauce) is
available at https://github.com/GlitchMr/Mango.

Just mentioning, not that this site is important. I just wanted to run
a web server just to run a web server.

By the way, this blog is also open sauce, you can see its source code
at https://github.com/GlitchMr/glitchmr.github.com. It's full of hacks,
but that's Jekyll for you.
