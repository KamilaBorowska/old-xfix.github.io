title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W28
---
This time, the changes mostly involve threading support (and promises)
in JVM version of Rakudo.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* [`categorize` discards value when mapper returns `()`, not `Nil`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/948f48a8eb17bc6289923b1499033ef45f193a18)

  As `Nil` is `()`, it shouldn't affect code returning `Nil`.

#### Rakudo Perl
* [Empty block doesn't return `Nil`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/63197602f7915de138ff1b26750aed8f5403b4bb)

* [`unshift` with infinite lists is now allowed.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7d7df4af01e009eb93245db391b73bafec02049c)

  It never made sense to disallow it, considering it was appending
  element at beginning of infinite list, not the end of it.

* ["Implemented" `is parcel`](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5023481f42c44ce1f1649b5375529a8fb44e39c6)

  For now, it means what `is rw` means.

* [`pop` and `shift` now are `is parcel`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/93f30e80e72dc79afb5d182d608a55b24f1935b0)

  Because `is parcel` is `is rw` for now, it changes nothing, but when
  `is parcel` will be implemented properly, it will allow assigning to
  list itself.

* [`.perl` recognizes typed hashes.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6933c1d36d06b71666cb3b0dfb0b8a0dbe493aff)

  Assuming that `%hash` is hash that accepts strings as values,
  `%hash.perl` now returns `Hash[Str].new(...)` instead of
  `(...).hash`.

* [`.perl` recognizes typed arrays.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8bd124f7ff378d55a127d64ca85f50ba213c75ea)

* [`$!`, `$/`, and `$_` are `Nil` by default.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0c2d61f45a0df6bbdcdc62ec57af92faddd2f58c)

* [`.join` is slightly faster.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/29a2480a50ce1636a4801ccf36a4e5417ad3d880)

  The optimizations aren't really noticeable (only for longer lists,
  and only around 5%), but they do exist.

* [Basic implementation of threads and promises in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b19f72b2983c0c601285a04bdaf7f54151820832)

* [Heredocs only dedent newlines found in actual code.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7157e1e80352682d0ca1c404a457e260a3e76cce)

  Interpolations aren't dedented anymore.

* [Dedenting is done at compile-time.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3f1c71d9fafb8a426b968f700932ad17dbbcb223)

  This should make heredocs faster.

* [`Parcel.new` actually works.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8e076257f79cbdbb11283b67e9ca4fba5913b0d7)

  It makes an empty parcel. Previously, it constructed `Parcel` object
  that wasn't (because it didn't have actual list).

* [Made various Pod parsing improvements.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/177)

* [Added `then` method to `Promise`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6f93caec4e10219734d79927e5ac5d1a1564ae60)

  It allows you to run code when promise is fulfilled or broken.

* [Added `await` method to `Promise`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/125f4582350c3be9a17eb046f93f97b9bd56a676)

  It waits for promise to complete, and returns the result.

* [Implemented `i`, `r`, `w`, and `x` methods of `IO::File` in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/44b57b5ec1ef72295b135cd78f53a4700b30ecb1)

* [Implemented `%` (modulo) in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/05624246f8cecda059b97a55362da5c041caa628)

* [Initialization of interop is delayed in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5cab6634ddfab82a00218800aafcee2f3ae73560)
