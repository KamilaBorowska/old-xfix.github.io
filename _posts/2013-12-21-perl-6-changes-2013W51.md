title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W50
---

Merry Christmas! Perl 6 _was_ released (3 years ago (Rakudo Star), but
it still counts in my opinion). [The Perl 6 Advent Calendar]
(http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/) is almost finished, if you are
interested in some Perl 6 tips. Rakudo Perl 2013.12 was released, and
all changes are already in.
