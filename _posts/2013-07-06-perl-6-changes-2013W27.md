title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W27
---
Many of changes in this article are JVM related. That shouldn't be
surprising - the JVM version of Perl&nbsp;6 still needs to be worked
on. However, it's working in many cases already, and you're welcome to
use it.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* Defined lots of terms in S99.

* [`Any` excludes `Nil`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/0d3a8a974e6d98fa6a5e0ccf6ae500eecae2e286)

* [Added `is parcel`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/45caa2bebfe3921e6f6155fa048bce98511d47d2)

  This means the value should be returned raw.

#### STD.pm6
* [Made error message for `undef` simpler.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/85cf51df887245caaa461be67d5e4e037b6a4b1e)

  Now it mentions undefined type object (such as `Any` or `Int`)
  instead of `Any` and `Int` separately.

#### Rakudo Perl
* [List/array adverbs now use empty array instead of `Nil`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9ded36c48f3ed1c19a7f2af7ca5f4e7bc8bae8f4)

  I love the changes that are reverted just after I make Perl&nbsp;6
  changes article.

* [`.=subst(...)` now works properly in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/21185446dcafbedf95e095c7405bc705acf0a77c)

* [`IO::Path::contents` is now implemented in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/1ca2ea24ace3d951f445249abb323696be43b0ad)

  This also makes `dir` function work.

* [Implemented `.d`, and `.s` filehandle methods in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/82437be6996c78759bf3b9a48150579a248217ea)

  They work exactly like `-d` and `-s` in Perl&nbsp;5. The other
  methods are still Parrot specific for now.

* [`Callable` replacement is now always called in `.subst`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b6d197f35d82cde63b41797fb3515c35e3891d2d)

  Previously, it wasn't called in rare case when subroutine wasn't
  taking arguments, thanks to logic ensuring "Too many positional
  passed; got 1 but expected 0" wouldn't be invoked, because of
  forgotten parenthesis.

* [Partially implemented macros in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7b0477579b4b99b2dff3d580172d46c6b2b2f5f9)

* [Implemented `is copy` for arrays in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/af39d66285d58c4cba08cdafde1cb0994422976a)

* [Implemented `is copy` for hashes in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/e7ad7742a00efa0a8bad15b5730c43fb60cbd415)

* [`enum` works properly in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8ca095c67f9b7bdb626b4b5026c3676dc297c8ef)

* [`NaN.Int` now throws proper error, and doesn't explode in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b3ee5fbf7881cefdcaf099c4fe0e8f87c65e1a2f)

  In Rakudo, `NaN.Int` by accident was returning `0`. In JVM, it was
  exploding. Now in both, it throws proper error.

* [Implemented `FIRST` in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/60d298632dd4a48078dd4b1f1e029d4099bc60e6)

* [Implemented `$*CWD` and `cwd()` in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/567941498b550353fd088c00f03e0ab2ba4a51fc)

* [`S11-modules/import-multi.t` now passes in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/dbc5f1a3036e3f1efb26b582038200a2e990125c)

* [Lexical accessor is generated after declaring var.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/080a6bb35f3f92cb71d845c2b382b62d5668d49a)

  Previously, doing stuff like `our Int $.variable` made accessor, but
  failed to declare variable itself, because `our` cannot have type
  constraint.

* [`dir` works properly on Win32, and recognizes `/` as path separator.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/532a3b939e932c06477206c4e3552e4b7a51a64e)

* [Fixed various multi-dispatch bugs in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/faa0f9eea0259b319f5599b8b92dbed90edffb29)

  Previously, JVM had `nqp::p6isbindable` always returning `true`
  (well, technically `1`, but that doesn't really matter, does it?).
  Now, JVM has implementation that actually works.

* [`$*TZ` now works in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5b1775fa0523022a03a628ad4affc6e2bb2dd521)

* [Error message about outdent being longer than shortest indent now works in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c83b634207c589cd43ae6149a948c47a9dbedb80)

  It depended on `sprintf()`, which isn't yet implemented in JVM.
  Because there was no reason to use `sprintf()`, now it uses simple
  variable interpolation.

* [Made `IO::Spec::QNX`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c929f048b80a6d8c3144f6b5d47d3656b96c814a)

  This class is mostly identical to `IO::Spec::Unix` (in fact, it
  inherits it), but supports double slashes.

* [Implemented `squish()`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f06928290d3f0722de70200b4e7f80e7550b107d)

* [Removed support for OS dependent `...`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9ece8b45e4bbecb22d5954a6b011479c7b26655f)

  `...` in Symbian and NetWare means `../..`. As Rakudo doesn't support
  these operating systems (in fact, OS owners themselves don't support
  these), it was removed.

* [`uniq` is now faster.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f60a2c111efe9a647d73ca641fcedea874e0f79d)

* [Implemented `CallFrame` in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/2208156056007a0e889e6aa12df1c74db5a2dcbe)

* [You cannot `push` and `unshift` infinite list.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/25e2f6b9746002b20dc317f01fc93efe2a8431de)

  When `push` or `unshift` want to add infinite list to list, it fails.

* [Hashes now have `.keyof` method, for determining type of keys.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/cd927656d7a1a379c50cd4cf10edfc4bb66a6857)

  This method is intended for typed hashes.

* [`MapIter` is now faster in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5a1e607503a34cbb92374234c98e68dcab58ae91)

* [Implemented `shell` in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0eab21a4d4a1476469eb062d4639e9088fc68b91)
