title:  Perl 6 changes - 2012W40
---
So, well. At beginning of this week, Rakudo Star was released. All
changes on this list aren't in current Rakudo version. So, well. It's
time for another Perl 6 changes report. It's not revolution, it's
evolution.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* `:ss` now implies `:s`.
* `:ii` now implies `:i`.
* `:mm` now implies `:m`.

#### Rakudo Star
* `(?i)` modifier was added.
* Implemented Perl 5 capture/alternation semantics.
* Implemented positive/negative lookahead/lookbehind.
* `:ii` now implies `:i`.
* Added `X::NoSuchSymbol` typed exception.
* `:ss` now implies `:s`.
* And of course, more native types.

#### Niecza Perl
* `.classify` and `.categorize` now return hashes.
