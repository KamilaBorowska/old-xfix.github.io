New features
============

Perl 6 specification
--------------------

* [Loops in statement list are now forced to be eager.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/251282d9f834b305afd095e11a9ddd17ad0f51a5)

  Loop like `sub loop { for 1..5 { say "Something" } }` is now eager,
  even when used in list context, even while `for` returns a value
  (implicit `return`).

  However, loop like `sub loop { (for 1..5 { say "Something" }) }`
  isn't eager, as `for` is inside parenthesis.

Rakudo Perl
-----------

* [`.total` method for `Set`/`Bag`/`Mix` is now cached.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ae27d10ad055e231d9791bda0a231434cc822c97)

  This makes `.total` faster if you use it a lot.

* [`Int`/`Num`/`Numeric`/`Real` casts also work on `QuantHashes`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9f94b8c60a6fa560e3a617087b25ccd85b6629a1)

* [`:delete` gives better error message when not supported.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/11bada4fe1f60456e59e502d2d36de0749799d46)

* [Implemented `.grabpairs` method.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c6b15dc4d8f00974d3e8ec51355a4651dd97dade)

* [Implemented `.package` method for backtraces.](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/commit/1349d129c51e0c698645c3806601a7c9ebfcef95)

  It isn't really neccessary, as `.code.package` was doing the same
  thing, but it's more logical that way.

* [Improved deprecation handler.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/70f2ae03f90681e23126b44e5d186f5b854bfd30)

  It can now tell the package which activated deprecation warning, and
  recommends you to contact the author of these calls.
