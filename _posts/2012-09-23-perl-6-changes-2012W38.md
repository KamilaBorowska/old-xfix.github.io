title:  Perl 6 changes - 2012W38
---
Another week, another Perl 6 changes report. I hope that changes
mentioned on this list will be exciting. Developers still work on
Perl 6... since 2000. Rakudo is still slow, but it's on average
30 times faster (but remember that 120% of numbers are made up).

### New features
#### Rakudo Perl
* Optimizer doesn't inline routines which got wrapped before `CHECK`
  time.
* In the error "Cannot wrap a HardRoutine, since it may have been
  inlined; use the 'soft' pragma to avoid marking routines has hard.",
  word "has" was changed to "as" (or as Perl 5/6 programmer would call
  it - `s/has/as/`).
* Fixed the bug which caused `require` to clobber `GLOBAL`.
* `KeySet` (the class itself, not its objects) now can be stringified
  without following error: "Parameter `''` requires an instance, but a
  type object was passed".
* Action methods default to `Mu` because it has less methods than
  `Any`. This way, action methods are less prone to name conflicts.
  The real fix for the problem will appear in future.
