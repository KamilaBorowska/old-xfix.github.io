title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W37
---
And now back to regularly scheduled filler, after the website update.
Rakudo Perl 2013.09 ("Shanghai") was released, and all (well, just one)
changes are (change is) already in.

New features
============

Perl 6 specification
--------------------

* [Existence now means that the value is different from default.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/710337efafa2487b58e7b41859ad0232853b4af2)

  For example, in the following code, `42` doesn't exist.

      my @array is default(42) = 42, 42, 42;
      say @array[1]:exists ?? "Yes" !! "No";

* [`/ [ ( something ) ]* /` is now defined.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/4128913f2b0c02386066a591ffbb933fb4260f43)

Rakudo Perl
-----------

* [`List.exists` and `List.delete` methods are implemented according to the specification.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6f8668484fe673440e0ddd7cc4a8bbf9050fb182)
