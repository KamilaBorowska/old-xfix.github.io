title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W37
---
One, ein, une, uno. One incompatible change nobody will care about,
and some bugfixes. Also, the Panda module manager now works in JVM.

### Potentially incompatible changes
#### Rakudo Perl
* [Removed `interval`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/79c0f515837fcc974b58f878ff0818a23206280c)

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* [`sleep` subroutines now accept `*` as `Inf`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/157b6052687c53e6112cf5201eab969af4a64062)

* [Added `mkdir` to the specification.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/db64e30e839ab7b9eb3a9fe3b2b557a1cb6beff0)

#### Rakudo Perl
* [`$!foo` params work inside roles.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/cdc323de726d9ba9dd41c39d08edf19c7ee48e09)

* [Added `pairs` method to `Setty`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0c87927893b0ee43578aef259c52abfa8adfb421)

* [Fixed set intersection, so now it does work.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9b4d4e1e0f1df09badaf232506f16957a294caa6)

* [`.KeySet` and `.KeyBag` always create new object.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/afa2a5cb19a04aba39e7a9631823127f44ce08ab)

* [`âˆ–` operator is now chaining, just like `(-)`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/bce4d7928bec52d7d5e6eeb29aa468d2c4c9858f)

* [`.pick` and `.roll` now work for large `Bag`s and `KeyBag`s.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/40ea141c94c71a7dbc046e03877ac7d7c3507a77)

  Previously, these methods made a large list. Now, these methods
  get number of elements (to get number random of), and sum bag
  elements, until random number will number of seen elements will be
  larger than random number.

* [Implemented `sleep-time`, and `sleep-till`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/79c0f515837fcc974b58f878ff0818a23206280c)

  It's also possible to go back in the time, like `sleep -1` - it does
  nothing, but it doesn't show error anymore.

* [Implemented absolute path lookup in `ModuleLoader`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/efac451801f3d685b02e2daddb89b99bf4e08d48)

  It was the only problem before Panda would work in JVM, and now, it
  works.
