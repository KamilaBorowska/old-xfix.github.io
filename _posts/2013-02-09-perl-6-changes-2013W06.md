title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W06
---
This time without any gimmicks (like five word sentences). This will be
simple description of changes I do regularly.

### New features (this time without building stuff part)
#### Rakudo Perl
* Constant folded `^..^` (infix) and `^` (prefix) operators.

#### Niecza Perl
* Added (borrowed from Rakudo Perl) the `Match.gist` method.
* Replaced "Unhandle conext character" error with "Unhandle con**t**ext
  character" error.
* Added Cool.set method. It can be used to convert argument to set.
* Added Cool.bag. Just like method above, it can be used to convert
  argument to bag.
