Potentially incompatible changes
================================

Perl 6 specification
--------------------

* [Listless map was changed into `Whatever` map.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/0f9df8a0f229d617abe810bd9af2768a48a3fe2b)

  `map { ... }` is now written as `map { ... }, *`.

* [All loops default to sink.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/27720668ed39efabc761b872525e01e38850541c)

  [Including `for`, which was changed in later commit.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/beef8e630be2440050c979252db56af227c910f2)

* [Renamed `$*PROGRAM_NAME` to `$*PROGRAM`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/6cdd9f3543d74a80678854a55fe7ff3c06f14ac7)

  The new name also requires stringification, as it's an object, not
  a string.
