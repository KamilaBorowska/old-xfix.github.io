title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W16
---
It's sixteen article in the series. The game goes so fast, and I still
haven't done pagination on my website (lazy as always). The scrollbar
is still shorter (1 pixel on my PC) than on Planet Six, but most likely
because of longer lines.

NQP was bootstrapped on JVM. That means it can compile itself. It still
doesn't support Perl 6 perfectly, because some code still uses `pir::`,
but it progressed really far. Also, the new version of Rakudo Perl,
2013.04 "Albany" was released. Every improvement mentioned here, is in.

I've decided to experiment with commit links this time. This way, you
can click (or press, or whatever, depends on your device, to get code
of this change).

### Potentially incompatible changes
#### Perl 6 specification
* Removed `IO::Dir` and `IO::File` classes. [fb25fa475854](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/fb25fa47585436c8f1d9e227f86e3de537e62cb1)

### New features
#### Rakudo Perl
* `IO::Path` is closer to actual spec. [24532aca13](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/24532aca13377bad63c57e428bb2a4c36ecf536f)
* Added `Bool` method to `Capture`. [9f873d89e3](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9f873d89e3538e8cc8c9c41cbc9abd6f78e6499b)
* `List.ACCEPTS` now has special `Whatever` handling. [f17d339185](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f17d339185c95e4b3b17230cb9b93032578e2a53)
* `do...for` doesn't propose `repeat...for` now. [41a92e808e](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/41a92e808ebc8d70eda169f549f9ece869019708)
* Documented build memory requirements (1GB of memory). [4109be8905](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/4109be8905860adf8369b51808c8e9d93970dfca)
* `require PATH|$variable|Module:file(PATH)` syntaxes are now accepted. [c946d0f7f7](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c946d0f7f715a8420917e518b9d7cad608519062)
* Removed reporting variable name for uninitialized variable warnings
  because it was producing too many false positives. [c39b887388](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c39b887388d85c70e0a2a17de8cdacf751461c7d)
* Replaced more `pir::` to `nqp::`. In particular, getting env
  variables is now done using NQP, not Parrot directly.
