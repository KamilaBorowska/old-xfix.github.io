title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W19
---
So, well, what's new. I'm going to answer - lots of changes and fixes.
Even the Niecza, where lately development had slowed down got lots of
fixes.

### Incompatible changes
#### Rakudo Perl
* [Array references aren't treated as arrays in regular expressions.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/37c7620bd6a9d45dcc452c4f468770b0bb3b7d62)

  Following code used to find 1, 2, or 3.

      my $array = [1, 2, 3];
      my $number = prompt 'Give me a number!';
      say "It's in array" if $number ~~ / ^ $array $ /;

  It doesn't do that anymore, because variables are expected to be
  stringified inside regexpes. If you want the old behavior, be explicit
  and write `@$array` instead of `$array`.

  Please note that currently regular expressions are exception to this
  rule. This is going to be fixed in the future. Lots of code depends
  on regexpes to be not stringified, and first the warnings will have
  to be implemented. You are expected to use `<$regexp>` instead of
  `$regexp`.

#### Niecza Perl
* [Changed `capitalize` to `wordcase`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/20128d7c56282831893e990597cd193ae8787dce)

  In the current specification, that method is named `wordcase`.

* [Removed `ucfirst`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/b1710c17918ec10b4629ce611d8ea58a9e962ccf)

  `ucfirst` was long deprecated, and it's finally time to remove it.
  You are expected to use `tc` instead.

* [Stringification of `Set`, `KeySet`, `Bag`, and `KeyBag` works properly when they are undefined.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/2e98224d3c26fe90b93d97cb42e8bab7b10f527d)

  Methods `Str`, `gist` and `perl` expected they deal with defined
  object. This isn't the case when dealing with the classes themselves.

* [Deprecated `$%` and `$@` variable checkers are working just like in STD.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/1d127e411ec6afe968b676aa1505c20d45d2ad1d)

  The `$@(1)` was complaining about use of deprecated variable, when the
  real problem was use of invalid hard reference syntax.

### New features
#### Rakudo Perl
* [`IO::Spec::Win32` no longer warns when using relative pathes.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/1b7852a45c9b47d229f2a4ac0c77536a1306c7a1)

  The check for initial prefix was using optional alternative
  (`([a | b | c])?`). Because of that, it was `Nil` if it matched
  nothing. Since the result of match was stringified just after it was
  matched, it returned a warning when `?` matches nothing. It was fixed
  to do `([a | b | c]?)` instead.

* [Added tests for `IO::Path` and `IO::Spec` to list of tests that should pass.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6e9f45691c8c0a6e2357196484c9a7d26973f68c)

  As `IO::Path` and `IO::Spec` were implemented, their tests are now
  ran when you request full test from roast test suite.

* [Interpolation of quotes in regexpes isn't done twice anymore.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/2696aab9249fd7cdb83ebaf644c80000cc3a432e)

  Previously, quotes inside RegExpes were doing interpolation two times.

* [`match` method is fast again.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/2696aab9249fd7cdb83ebaf644c80000cc3a432e)

  [One of the older commits](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c255f1d)
  made it 10 times slower. The performance regression was fixed, and
  now `match` is as fast as it used to be.

* [`wordcase` method now accepts `where` which is `Mu`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ad71045014a6da4fef5d5c0bff73331cd6a41712)

  Previously, only `Any` values were accepted. While using `Mu` doesn't
  make much sense, there is no reason to disallow it, so it's allowed
  now.

* [Configuration instructions don't say to use --gen-nqp.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/782dec0df77b8d3f0d621de9ed06dd151e630bff)

  It was pointless, since `--gen-parrot` automatically implied
  `--gen-nqp`. If you want Parrot, it's safe to assume you want NQP for
  that Parrot too, right?

* [`our` hashes and arrays work.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/bfd8508f5ceee565380da201ef25bdfb6feb2b3d)

  If you had used `our @array`, and `our %hash`, the object wasn't
  initialized properly, and it wasn't working like array or hash. This
  made `our` work only with `$scalar`s previously.

  Previously, trying to use `our` with arrays or hashes caused strange
  uninitialized variable to appear. It didn't have `STORE` method, so
  you couldn't have put anything in this variable, and had `Any`
  instead of empty array of hash.

* [It's now possible to augment empty list.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b1695cf3bb9ef32225d5862551253897f0667634)

  `MONKEY_TYPING` couldn't be used to modify lists. Now it can.

#### Niecza Perl
* [`Pair.perl` can now deal with the cases when `Pair` is the key.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/31f36d2a2fb76e6c819670860e2d892b25d9a397)

  Doing `((a => 'b') => 'c').perl` used to output `"a" => "b" => "c"`,
  what actually meant `(a => (b => 'c'))`. `.perl` now outputs correct
  code in that case.

* [Implemented Hash.ACCEPTS.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/69a3432d221934d6719ddbb4316d51f924af9149)
