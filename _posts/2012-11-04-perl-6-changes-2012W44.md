title:  Perl 6 changes - 2012W44
---
I apologize for being late, Gabor Szabo. I simply forgot about writing
this. This week, the main attraction is proper quote constructs
support.

### Incompatible changes
#### Rakudo Perl
* `IO::Path.dir` was removed. You're expected to use
  `IO::Path.directory` instead. Also, named parameter in `IO::Path`
  constructor was renamed from `:dir` to `:directory`.

### New features
#### STD.pm6
* Postfix operators like `.foo-bar` take precedence above method calls.

#### Rakudo Perl
* Better delimiter handling. For example, `rx` and `m` allow delimiters
  other than `//` or `{}`.
* Quote adverbs, such as `:w` or `:x` are supported.
* Implemented `andthen` infix operator.
* You can specify input line separator on new sockets using
  `:input-line-separator` named argument.
* Quotes have better error reporting.
* Heredocs are implemented.
* Macro arguments now carry lexical envirnoment properly.
* Postfix operators like `.foo-bar` take precedence above method calls.
* Git merge conflicts markers are now detected properly.

#### Niecza Perl
* `qw` is unsafe and cannot be used in safe (sandbox) mode.
* Postfix operators like `.foo-bar` take precedence above method calls.
