title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W14
---
You may have noticed may page went down for some time. This appears to
be connected to [newest domain change]. In order to be more... modern,
I've moved the repository to `glitchmr.github.io`, but that made entire
page to go down. I apologize for inconvience, but it didn't affected
Planet Six, so I think it's fine.

As always, I'm going to describe changes in Perl 6.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* Renamed `weekday-of-month` to `day-of-week-in-month`.

#### Rakudo Perl
* Fixed signature of `Pod::Block.gist`, so it works properly with
  `multi`s.
* `for` loops are eager now.
* Added `Buf.perl`.
* Fixed `Buf.gist`, so it works properly with `multi`s.
