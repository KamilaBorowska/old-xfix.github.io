title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W09
---
I would put a description, but who seriously cares?

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* Inside of `try` is considered eager context, unless `try` is called
  in sink context, when it's in sink context.

#### Rakudo Perl
* Type placeholders (like `Int`, which is null, except Int typed) now
  have their `.gist` method show their name within parens to suggest
  being undefined. For example, `(Int)`, `(Mu)`.
* Changed "Cannot assign to a non-container" error message to "Cannot
  modify an immutable value" that hopefully is more clear.
* Release announcements now use Markdown.
* `Cool.substr` doesn't coerce its first argument to `Int` anymore.
