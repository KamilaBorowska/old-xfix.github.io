title:  Perl 6 changes - 2012W41
---
So, I apologize for forgeting about doing this yesterday. It's another
boring Perl 6 changes report. I'm going to make another blog post soon,
but as you can see, I'm sort of lazy, so all I have for now is "Perl 6
changes" article. Enjoy.

### New features
#### Rakudo Perl
* `has $.foo` is now allowed to extend `method foo { ... }` in role,
  just like it would be real method.
* Implemented `:handles` trait mod.
* Implemented `x` in `pack`.
* `.substr` now can have `Inf` as last argument.
* `ByteBuffer` now can be serialized when using `--target=pir`.
* `perl6 -e` code can begin with `-` sign.
* Added `$*CUSTOM-LIB` magic variable.
* Rakudo now searches for modules in
  `$installpath/lib/parrot/$parrot-version/languages/perl6/custom-lib`.

#### Niecza Perl
* `.gamma`, `.expm1` and `.log1p`, `.erf` methods are now implemented.
* Added `$*CUSTOM-LIB` magic variable.
