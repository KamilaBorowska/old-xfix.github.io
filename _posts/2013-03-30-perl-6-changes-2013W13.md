title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W13
---
The month is coming to end, and with that, I'm going to make yet
another list of changes.

### New features (like anything is other than that)
#### Perl 6 specification
* Added many `IO::Path` methods: `.contents`, `.is-absolute`,
  `.is-relative`, `.absolute`, and `.relative`.
* `.path` is now NOP that returns itself. For its previous behavior,
  use `.Str`.
* Changed `Numeric.conjugate` to `Numeric.conj`.

#### Rakudo Perl
* `+(23..2300000000)` is optimized.
* `--help` reports `-I` and `-M` options.
