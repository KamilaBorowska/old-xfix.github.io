title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W21
---
Before I begin, I apologize for being really late with this article. I
had this article ready for really long time, but for some reason forgot
to commit it.

I would like to thank entire Perl 6 community for providing very good
product, and even providing already compiled builds I can test stuff on
[Perl 6 Community Development Server](http://perlcabal.org/).

Rakudo Perl 2013.05 was released. This not Rakudo Star, and according
to the policy, it isn't mentioned on Rakudo webpage, to avoid confusion
with Rakudo Star. Every change mentioned here is in.

### Incompatible changes
#### Perl 6 specification
* [`first` doesn't throw exception, but returns `Nil`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/381e96a2d7edcf745f160644297f4ee924a1a405)

  `Nil` means no value. This change could break code that depends on
  `first` making an exception.

* [`slurp` supports `IO::Handle`s.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/c2ac9b87beeb748f3f97def81524e1480dbbea37)

  The file you have opened should be allowed to be slurped, just like
  the file you haven't opened yet.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* [Added `WHY` method.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/2d423f2f1fa0a6171a00d121c6089cb9c8ca5862)

  It contains attached Pod value.

#### STD.pm6
* [Perl 5 variable `$,` only errors when it's obvious.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/8850393dd76c49f51ae79a2da31dd3b6fb63b7ed)

  Now it only warns when appended by one of following characters:
  `= , ; ? : ! ) ] }` (or by end of script).

* [Parser now warns about `.kv` after subscript.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/033608798daf047735dd08ed8e8513ebd1a78602)

  This helps to avoid confusion with `:kv` adverb. If you really meant
  that, use `\.kv`.

#### Rakudo Perl
* [Slice adverbs support false booleans.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5e360a6fa2367e99cbf29492512966c49e4aefc6)

  You can write code like `%a<b> :!exists` to check whatever the
  element doesn't exist.

  You can also write code like `%a<b> :!delete` which does nothing,
  but can be used for conditionally deleting hash keys (for example
  `%a<b> :delete(%a<c> :!exists)`).

* [`dir` works properly on pathes with volumes.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/849f4f68644ed7acdc49d0c23ecff55e806cdbed)

  This affected platforms such as Windows (actually, is there any
  platform other than Windows that Rakudo supports and has volumes).

* [`.hash` accepts optional `:type` and `:of` named parameters.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/61db0e0134dd03aaf89af9a177c2bd33caed3118)

* [`spurt` is not allowed in restricted setting.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c52f15f0e22626a2e38b1cbe2742e418378c930f)

  Writing to file in restricted setting doesn't make any sense, so it's
  disallowed now. Please note that restricted setting was never meant
  as sandbox (you can easily ignore it by calling `nqp::` or `pir::`
  methods directly), but rather for services that execute code, to
  provide better error reporting for features that are disallowed
  anyway on higher level.

* [`link`, `symlink`, and `chmod` not allowed in restricted setting.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/362a098be92ffd3fb0716781aecc38cb2e6c163e)

  Ditto, but with different commit.

* [`Pod::Block::Declaractor.gist` now works.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ad0c3f07b8722688e2ed7883676944c207755a54)

  Previously, `gist` method had invalid signature, and failed.

* [`List` and `Parcel`s have `.Set` and `.Bag` method.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/a134b18ca72eaf5c902250674b6b8aa475748fe7)

  It works just like `set` and `bag` subroutine, except as a method.

* [`:exists` works with slices.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/267c54c11e273d7d0843640e7a86bdaacdc465ce)

  It's allowed by a spec. Previously, it shown error "Cannot use exists
  adverb with a slice".

* [`slurp` supports `IO::Handle`s.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/1a9b0da7e0de65795e9920889b0c4b928d333914)

* [Implemented `IO::Handle.slurp`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5fa040fb7ba60e4972e2eda66cbfe6a816b5e7e7)

  It's a logical step, considering `slurp` as a function already works.

* [Perl 5 variable `$,` only errors when it's obvious.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/25bfa5fa80f9ff2b849578af45b6f31da8606aba)

* [`$%` and `$@` itemizers are now allowed.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/90daa18887159503da3db18554b18c111bf49899)

  You don't have to type `$(%` and `$(@` for something that actually
  makes sense, just because Perl 5 didn't allowed it. In Perl 5, these
  work similarly to `\%` and `\@`.
