More potentially incompatible changes than ever, but the changes are
relatively minor, and unlikely to be triggered.

### Potentially incompatible changes
#### Perl 6 specification
* [`is ref` is now `is parcel`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/a02e2e1d48a4a2f8694d5767cfe8e7b4f95491fd)

#### Rakudo Perl
* [Removed internals `exists_key` and `delete_key` methods.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9a63eade18274bf998fb46c9f6cc5126a6757712)

  They aren't used in the core, and aren't part of specification (which
  uses `:exists` and `:delete`).

* [Bags aren't iterable anymore.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/a426d5a1d94cd9751e698fbabc9d2aa460006586)

  This fixes problems with bags being flattened in many places.

* [Removed `keybag` method.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7bd19cf118e6d3d71ae99446fc2f2542a78859fa)

  It was never specced, and it only existed for a month.

* [`infix:<mod>` doesn't coerce its values.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/a13cec987ad2dbb73a84a7a04246069988016624)

  This makes it fail when called using real values.

#### Niecza Perl
* [`bless` doesn't have first candidate argument.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/d49208e89013cdd823c76415c2fec89de0f41684)

  This is huge change, intended to make blessing easier. For
  compatibility reasons, Niecza still supports candidate argument, but
  it shows a huge warning (well, standard warning), encouraging you to
  fix it. Also, yes, I know I reused previous description from Rakudo.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* [`Buf.subbuf` accepts arguments like `*-1`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/e05910e1155e661e934a1f4627020ec38188f8b8)

  This makes it work more like `Str.substr`.

* [Added new `sleep-timer` and `sleep-till` functions.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/fcd17ad88c4b8002f7ab78a929fe32a6471a70ac)

#### Rakudo Perl
* [Ranges starting with lists/arrays work.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5d09997669b49a4210c51a0810025b03d37a3d2a)

  If you write something like `(2, 2)..4`, you get range that works
  like `2..4` (because `(2, 2)` is converted to number of elements, in
  this case, 2.

* [`$var.++` now works.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ce3ea3924be21d974a5f6a43f9f701be415052e0)

  It's now possible to use postfix operators as methods.

* [`Any.exists` and `Any.delete` now only works for undefined values, when not used on containers.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/39024d80511ea3c706795ca6d9800af8e05d32f1)

  Previously, nonsensical code like `42.delete(24)` worked. However,
  `.exists` and `.delete` exist for convenience of autovivication that
  should error on normal scalar values.s

* [`Set.delete` and `Bag.delete` are hidden from backtrace.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7a71ec768585c963d5a3ed94f95c5de0780ff630)

* [Added `KeyBag.delete` and `KeySet.delete`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/e7d2175028911953b0be5134a9143b30d38a3588)

* [Added `TEMP` blocks.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6fddda1fd2058d312b6af149b6224ccafa5d300c)

* [Implemented `tr///` by wiring it to `.trans` method.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/152a5398f9358b1b49ecb21dfa34322a180bdfe9)

* [`"".ord` returns `Int`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/bb2d2e2108926632db9a7c1c5e9401ba27bfb9af)

  This behavior is not part of the spec, but was already implemented by
  Niecza.

* [`.tc` is `Cool` method.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/bab03d30d7022810175a73cdf4d19dd111390473)

* [`Buf.subbuf` accepts arguments like `*-1`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5becd4f8b43ce9baff3020c39880948eacf4e210)

* [`KeySet` is now instance of `Set`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8bfb3c7d67740f55f67e33737211eedf3851dc64)

* [You can have `Bag`s of `Bag`s.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/a25616110271d5f1a26c5f1cfff8a40ea9a7ff38)

  [Unlike NetHack](http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Bag_of_holding#Putting_dangerous_items_into_bags_of_holding),
  you can now put bags in bags without losing a bag.

* [You cannot have bag with negative count of elements.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/3feb92eb42553a326f51804a987939f32190da7f/src/core/Bag.pm)

  When generating a bag from pairs, counts cannot be negative.

* [Added `IO::Socket(::INET)` port to JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f18135490ce1b9dbc4a4ad98ade9d8117c239313)

### Niecza Perl
* [Implemented `Any.end`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/10420542357705518cf16de12ecae35edc68081d)

* [`Inf` shows `inf` in `printf`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/a6d4c5f5518577ddb70bdd27845b40048204fa89)
