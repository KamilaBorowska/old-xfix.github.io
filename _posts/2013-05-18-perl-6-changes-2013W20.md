title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W20
---
This week, the most notable change would be Rakudo sort of working on
Java Virtual Machine. It still needs lots of improvements, but it can
already run "Hello, world" program, what is important milestone in
Rakudo for JVM.

### Incompatible changes
#### Perl 6 specification
* [You cannot create a set or bag from list of pairs or hash using a constructor.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/1e7aec467b4eb83738513f0bcb6d6ff07e89ec95)

  The `bag {a => 2}` was ambiguous, because it could mean either `bag`
  containing `'a'` with value `2`, or `bag` containg `{a => 2}` with
  value `1`.

  You're expected to use `.Bag` or `.Set` instead, if you mean that.

#### STD.pm6
* [You cannot use `set` or `bag` to mean empty set or bag.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/e2a36d862079acb91106f89bad8cb03e8279545d)

  If you really meant that, you are expected to use `set()` or `bag()`
  instead.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* [Slice adverbs support false booleans.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/fd94c282259268cc02bfc46e7a4c52488f34f927)

  You can write code like `%a<b> :!exists` to check whatever the
  element doesn't exist.

  You can also write code like `%a<b> :!delete` which does nothing,
  but can be used for conditionally deleting hash keys (for example
  `%a<b> :delete(%a<c> :!exists)`).

* [Sets and bags use `===` semantics.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/221b79f028ef77d1e9fec478b3d6933bf476fc9f)

  Previously the specification hasn't said which semantics should be
  used. As anything other than `===` semantics would be slow, `===`
  semantics are used.

* [Defined `INIT`/`END` across modules.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/14e9ce6c8a7cb5f9f7c69d7c18b8a405031c4b33)

* [Added `FINAL` and `COMPOSE` phases.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/a7444d895a3641df8ee44311f3613c1612c4de33)

  `FINAL` is ran at link time. `COMPOSE` is ran when a role is composed
  into a class.

#### STD.pm6
* [`set<a b c>` has special error message.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/e2a36d862079acb91106f89bad8cb03e8279545d)

  This syntax wasn't useful for anything, except for perhaps
  obfuscation. It meant creating empty set, and getting keys `'a'`,
  `'b'`, and `'c'` from it. As the empty set doesn't have these keys,
  it was returning `False` 3 times.

  As the behavior doesn't make any sense, you probably wanted to use
  `set <a b c>` instead. The old behavior is still accessible using
  `set()<a b c>`, but I don't think you would want to use this.

* [Perl 5 grammar allows version in `require` statement.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/4dc2553cbf357c3616f7e71d1c7ac2bac145c857)

  In Perl 5, you can write code like `require 5.010` do make runtime
  version check (as opposed to `use 5.010` which is compile time
  check). The Perl 5 grammar, included as part of `STD.pm6` now
  supports this syntax.

* [`FINAL` and `COMPOSE` phases is now recognized.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/9906f18ffb0e0e2cc2b685d56a1febb55ff4e014)

  Now that these phases are in specification, the grammar was modified
  to recognize them.

#### Rakudo Perl
* JVM version of Rakudo supports simplest "Hello, world!" program.

* [Fixed infinite recursion in `IO::Spec::Unix.rel2abs`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/738531ae8b81805d59ebb79ec46e1f35b40efcf6)

  `rel2abs` made infinite recursion if neither `$path` or `$base` were
  absolute.

* [`infix:<~>` is constant folded.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/a9f3c63d3aa9854ad4e5ab05b0809659db42a0ec)
* [`<prefix:<~>` is constant folded.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0d3c9b08fd28214d34f68fb222ae39aad84c16f0)
* [String comparison operators are constant folded.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0d3c9b08fd28214d34f68fb222ae39aad84c16f0)
* [String bitwise operators are constant folded.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0d3c9b08fd28214d34f68fb222ae39aad84c16f0)
* [`defined` is constant folded.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b41219e4f001d6029e3bdb6adb69198376f0a085)

* [`Set`, `KeySet`, `Bag`, and `KeyBag` have `default` method.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/17085660c99009d2901233812270b4dba246edf4)

  When reading undefined property of those classes, `default` method
  contains value that you should receive. In case of sets, it's
  `False`. For bags, it's `0`.

* [Regexpes support more delimiters.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/86cf85a372ddd3e23b4df74b55b6873afa72f318)

  Previously, Rakudo didn't accept regexpes like `m^42^` or `m€cash€`.
  Now, they are allowed, just like in Perl 5.

#### Niecza

* [`Set`, `KeySet`, `Bag`, and `KeyBag` have `default` method.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/009f999b8ee82047259955f741685a263c3976a0)

  Just like in Rakudo, except with Niecza.
