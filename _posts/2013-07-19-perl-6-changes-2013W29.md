title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W29
---
Considering Rakudo 2013.07 was released, I've decided to make this
article earlier than usually. It's also important milestone,
considering Rakudo on JVM passes 99% of tests that Rakudo on Parrot
passes.

### New features
#### STD.pm6
* [`for $variable {...}` now warns.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/c2215f042bf75ed1c592467bd65f837382dcaf94)

  As it only makes iteration over one element, Perl 6 warns you, and
  recommends `@$variable` (if you actually wanted to flatten item) or
  `given $variable {...}` (if you want item topicalization).

#### Rakudo Perl
* [JVM now checks type of return values.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ebb29bed9898007367f59cfcbab278fad1a387a8)

  When declaration a subroutine return type, JVM now actually checks
  it.

* [JVM now fails calling function when called with too many arguments.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/37bf15c2a110f4ed7b87b2ee815682bc235b48bc)

* [Exceptions show proper stacktraces in JVM when thrown in `eval`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d57a8e3988790fb6388a5698b069a42d5b3dcc78)

* [Unspace works before function arguments.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6b355be1a02149c734270f4475cc2760f80f5952)

  `say\ (42)` now works properly.

* [JVM supports `LEAVE`/`KEEP`/`UNDO`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/45fb1bad71dcb9b9371473fb7f763b840b7f6e6e)

* [Implemented `PRE`/`POST`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d4ffd7c21e7bed97eeeec3502299da0d1276abd4)

* [`List.first` is now lazy.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/56fad03b58505c93f3e4ba4975b077d882563bc1)

* [`uniq` and `squash` are faster.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/624ff76ca66f39d96878fbf201ebbedc9c6a7d6b)

  `uniq` is 56% faster, and `squish` is 28%, thanks to rewrite using
  `map` instead of `grep`.

#### Niecza Perl
* [`for $variable {...}` now warns.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/1f87209320019f3e82a38f631859990136383eb3)
