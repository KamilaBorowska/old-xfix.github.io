title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W03
---
It's another Perl 6 changes article (at this point I wonder why I
still do that). But as long the changes are impressive (and the cake
is the lie), I guess mentioning changes is worth it.

Rakudo 2013.01 was tagged in the Git repository. It wasn't yet
released, but it's really close to the releease (and frozen).

### New features
#### Rakudo Perl (in Rakudo 2013.01)
* `** 0` in regexpes works correctly matching nothing.

#### Niecza Perl
* More meaningful error message is thrown when `printf` tries to
  consume more arguments than available.
