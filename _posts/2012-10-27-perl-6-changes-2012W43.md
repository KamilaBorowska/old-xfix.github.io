title:  Perl 6 changes - 2012W43
---
Rakudo Star 2012.10 will be released soon, but before that will happen,
I'll list changes in Perl 6 specifications and implementations. Not
many changes, but many of those are very important. Personally, I find
custom operators precedences, `<< >>` quotes and prototypes in core
subroutines very impressive improvements - it was all done in one week.  

### New features
#### Rakudo Star
* Custom operators can now have precedences.
* `<< >>` quotes now support interpolation.
* Perl 6 grammars are pre-computed.
* `eval` now sees custom operators.
* Not-found dynamic values make better error messages.
* `${variable}` now makes better error message.
* `read` now exists again in `IO::Socket`.
* Many core subroutines now have prototypes. This allows doing stuff
  like `@array.map: &sin`.
