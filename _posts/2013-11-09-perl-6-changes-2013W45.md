Potentially incompatible changes
================================

Perl 6 specification
--------------------

* [Removed polymorphic types.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/d8cd922a5a4c69e68f96867432b62cac2ba65e0a)

  They never were implemented in real implementations.

* [Removed `$*TICK` global variable.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/0b52065aeee07739a5c26cbc3efb026eda1bf71b)

* [Removed `:chop` from quoted strings.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/6d0e7610c7cb8fd75489dbd67af7bf6a9c83d55f)

  Instead, it's job of optimizer to optimize string when it sees
  `.chop` used on constant string.

* [Changed `Increase`/`Decrease` to `Less`/`More`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/5e2c420566a46af03937c95f6ed0d7051a29aba2)

Rakudo Perl6
------------

- [Moved `.select` (in threading) to `.winner`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9d8349250453ba0370845a2ce4a726609bd20ac7)

- [Moved `.keeper` (in threading) to `.vow`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/186b4511251e884fae386e32a57d12d4f0fc054d)

- [Moved `Supply.untap` to `Supply.close`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6f360f5a0c2bd7346be6c126e1aa2595e7291d79)

- [`.schedule` methods renamed to `.cue`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d2cc29879c4d9009b03f91dab35d142e936e145e)

New features
============

Perl 6 specification
--------------------

* [Added threading synopsis.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/0b11765d37acafd8f074386423c1cae2b3e4e83b)

  It had lots of improvements after being written, some of them
  mentioned in Rakudo changes.

* [Added `glob`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/955852e867a01b73a5b32aeef820566440efb168)

Rakudo Perl
-----------

- [Fixed `$var .= substr()` short form not saving to `$/`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/1d15c6e8dde9c5e3379b8eb8682b2ea51498e667)

- [Empty itemized parcel shows `$( )` on `.perl`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d916dbe88e33877858b9b242bc380b9d8f741115)

  Previously `$( ).perl` caused `$()` to appear, which is a special
  variable.

- [Changed `Increase`/`Decrease` to `Less`/`More`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/132a970753c6e4bd43f2a25dc8e4ac484e9039f5)

  This makes the values less surprising compared to numeric values.

- [`infix:<...>` is a proper list infix.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/cab74042762161b17e20b5da23173956d96fe4ce)

  Now it can appear several times.
