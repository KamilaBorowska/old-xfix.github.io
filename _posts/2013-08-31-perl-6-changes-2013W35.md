title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W35
---
The month ends. And with the end of it, the new Perl&nbsp;6 changes
article appears (well, it's a coincidence, the new article appeared
because it's Saturday, not end of the month.

Also, the counter of something: 3. What does it count, I'm not sure,
but I guess it doesn't really matter.

### Potentially incompatible changes
#### Perl 6 specification
* [Replaced `Pod6::` with `Pod::`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/6af26e329dd77cfe65f8c5656f05c35b387d9b62)

  It isn't really incompatible change, as Perl&nbsp;6 implementations
  already did that.

#### Rakudo Perl
* [`bless` doesn't have first candidate argument.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/de909c2d578b75871a14e59b260c446cd9a691fe)

  This is huge change, intended to make blessing easier. For
  compatibility reasons, Rakudo still supports candidate argument, but
  it shows a huge warning (well, standard warning), encouraging you to
  fix it.

* [Changed `X::Comp::Trait` into `X::Comp::Trait::Unknown`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/2d28fdd1c114635114ba6baf263e98d3d94c519c)

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* [Updated `Range`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/bdec1f7c694632e131306d690b154ed117c55cb6)

* [Specify `bounds()` to return a `Parcel`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/850de3fb29d22f666bb09e8be5322661c373884b)

  Feel free to blame me for that one.

#### STD.pm6
* [You can now use multiple unspaces in sequences.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/d699c5faf72a7ce3cead081aa3335e2bf3ccaa13)

* [You can use numerals with `_` in regex ranges.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/27326bc097fae7308cd333ea80e8fbf5843ee18e)

#### Rakudo Perl
* [Removed instruction to implement `%!` when using it.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/cacdd1b2e59ef9696531671345979f45a3d2656b)

  Use your time to put a description here. [You can send a Pull Request,
  if you want to](https://github.com/GlitchMr/glitchmr.github.io).

  Anyway, you can probably see why it was removed.

* [`@a.VAR.name` and `%h.VAR.name` now work.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/283f763a5e670e66951ec837a761088f26e9cad9)

* [`tc` (titlecase) method is now implemented.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/fe289bf2dc085360b23fb5abdc48ca164d5c15c3)

* [Added `Any.exists` and `Any.delete`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/789db4ff6ea69df7d9bf0c8b8a9b260035bf6896)

  This is temporary hack method implementing `:exists` and `:delete`.
  [It's intentionally not implemented for `Bag`s and `Set`s]
  (https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/90cfaa0c64a2959bcc70f4f3b4585bec3039e7cf).

* [`%h<a><b> := "foo"` binding now works.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8a6a949ec217dd435377c615c6c7839c6fd4d8a7)

* [Fixed `is default(Nil)`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/386a090af0c21c0d2d7f29397e79f6ba8a7e3c06)

* [Rakudo JVM sets executable name to `perl6`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/dcae5cbc71cb06c887d0633c9273883e01122306)

* [Made better error message for `my int $a is default(42)`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3bdc0c3f6f82ccde184713ee981dfb58dbd04b53)

* [Implemented `Set`/`Bag` changes from Niecza.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ea063604298fff0ab4374324409b3eea2572d418)

  It involves adding new operators, adding `Set`, `KeySet`, `Bag`,
  `KeyBag` operators, and other changes mentioned previously in Niecza
  Perl category.

* [`.delete` in `Set`/`Bag` throws `X::Immutable`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/95b45b4bb14166b845023ebf9bf0d4599a69fd9e)
