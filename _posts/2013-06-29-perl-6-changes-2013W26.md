title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W26
---
The latest issue was huge. That one is slightly (it's two pages on
GitHub, not three) smaller on size, but it still contains lots of
changes.

The changes mostly involve implementing stuff that wasn't in JVM.
JVM is still buggy, but it's now usable.

### New features (like it's ever anything else)
#### Perl 6 changes
* [Specified `Hash.exists` and `Hash.delete` as internal methods.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/39ab531f386588301dd84095af5c6bffa545b76c)

* [`.round` returns `Real`, not `Int`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/0cca600925867743b3b7c5126335145f89090bb9)

* [Done big rewrite of S11.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/4425736dd263222921a1da70e1a834e4da3b2961)

  It's hard to discuss about changes, considering most of it was
  changed. It introduced `unit` statement, and done lots of minor
  changes.

* [Added Perl 6 glossary as Synopsis 99.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/fce8a2f8084258aed962521237a445dc53b2837f)

  No, Perl 6 doesn't have 99 synopsis. This is just a way to put more
  synopsis later. This is intended to be last synopsis.

* [Documented `IO::Path.succ` and `.pred`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/0af5ba1ae07538d10e6ba6121c46ab0f6382424c)

* [Added named `:parent` option to `IO::Path.cleanup`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/78487b0e5e6edb0823fd72236667e21a5e9b33e0)

* [Added `Complex` rounders.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/71e9f8551c297d7840c3dca9e3bbf4382a2bd92d)

* [Specified that `.classify` and `.categorize` don't work on infinite list.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/30396f0dab2bb0c1253439b09bb183924a16a1ab)
  
#### Rakudo Perl
* [`next`, `last`, and `redo` use generic code, instead of JVM specific in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8506c14cff3c0e444e13a9a6b0711774f818cf48)

* [`List.elems` for infinite list returns `Inf` in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/4040ef105c78496bd22f6e20952fc68f1b910ae5)

  Previously, it depended on coercion that doesn't happen in JVM.

* [Testing JVM now forces compiling `Test` class for performance.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c3a8e6892c73b685448ae4a5a11464a2a7c5f752)

* [You can run `make` on Windows.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/474868004b64e28275de39240517fbc32ce1ab2f)

* [You can `sort` arrays in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d0583733729ba5a0c33883cacec3e4054e7de67a)

* [`is_pseudo_package` works in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/51d0246bed80b546411f0f4d4fa6c372c5a1b68a)

  This makes [S02-names/indirect](https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/master/S02-names/indirect.t)
  test work.
  
* [`$_` is handled properly in binder.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ea421602a32dea070fda1f6696804fc40465bfd8)

  This makes [S02-names/pseudo](https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/master/S02-names/pseudo.t)
  test work.

* [`create-jvm-runner.pl` fails when called without arguments.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/85f737212cd63abfdfec06432ed3482e49a07bb6)

* [Fixed 'Unable to coerce natively typed parameter' error message when `error` is `NULL` pointer.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/e7596b694d21cba6c20e750a070aafd386debbf3)

* [Implemented `as Type` signature for coercing.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9a89c8ede684506856faf29764abc27381d78588)

  This feature can be used to automatically cast value to specific
  type. For example, `Cool $something as Str`, to require `Cool` value
  that would be coerced to `Str`.

* [`Num.new` works in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/30c82c76c3c7ab7eee932fac3a3cb1435b9cfb44)

  Previously, it depended on coercion of `Int` `0` to `Num`. Now it
  properly returns `0e0`.

* [Fixed `NullPointerException` in `infix:<?^>`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/614d9e0302bde46c7789e9fd1b6d71579898357d)

* [When assigning to `Scalar`, JVM now checks whatever you can write to it.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/03e005cd278938fe968cb839e29650f2c016a418)

* [`slurp` now works.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/2aa4972c6df4aca604888b41479cad32ebc70e4c)

* [Iteration works with typed hashes.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d02067f5a58c7f0234bb4df75c10f864d4c93980)

* [`given`/`when` works as lvalue.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/01fc34b8c10ba12c4cfb5635f7f2b1e4e7eb4958)

* [`Junctions` now work properly in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/51f4ebe38e484a99e45683ff1f16856c425255af)

  This passes most of tests for junctions.
  
* [Added `Int.round` with arguments.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/077875a341993f800414ef67bccf5e98eeb08f1d)

* [Converting range to array now works in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c050747edb662669eb557f7146cf0dd829516994)

* [`$*PID` now works in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7f0af9bca599919d537b0a2b02b79cccd07d6ede)

* [`CATCH` now works in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/38173e77a9d96f6cbbfb8fffdecfd875a895655e)\

* [Implemented `Complex.ceiling`, `.floor`, and `.round`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7192039c5674dd69c348374867127fa826971f25)

  They work _mostly_ like in Mathematica, with exception for midpoint
  rounding, when value is rounded down.

* [Object cache is flushed when objects are mixin in.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/90094405e880179b7ae4379e78f28d0994823ff3)

  This makes compilation of `infix`es smaller. Previously, 10 infixes
  generated 9MB `.pir` file, now it only generates 1.2MB file.
  
* [Renamed "absense" to "absence" in `undef` error message.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ffa9838c8b1b0a5958c0d7db99e01cc52c39b3ac)

* [`Attribute.gist` is nicer.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5c0dae4cfa18f1876f5a2f6306f599241f3f4fca)

* [Creating `Pair`s is _slightly_ faster.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9880c7b2d8fdb446241f35576b435fee2a4f9f13)

  `Pair` object now has one reference, not two.

* [Testing doesn't skip ICU tests in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/2b77d6dcd0454a911678d19b94a5d7175932cd2a)

  JVM doesn't need ICU, so while it doesn't have it, it should run
  Unicode tests anyway.
  
* [`[]:(kv|p|k|v)` works like in specification.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3e586874aba547f638a279d4866352507bbc0425)

* [Implemented `Complex.truncate`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d7a961c9b093d36d01e4158b76db4d1bccef05ef)

* [Implemented `interval($seconds)`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3952e96965432b46beed3ca119a4937bd2b67a0d)

* [`undefine` now works properly.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/bbc2b3f4b1d88b9b35bf02a4a584e86b073a548e)

  Previously it assigned `Any`, now it assigns `Nil`.
  
* [`IO::Spec` now builds in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7db8e2c29885ab69dd8defabf20a2a1e6b3c1b11)

* [JVM now supports `.subst` when replacement count was set to 0.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/412307989be6df484710ac7d46bb72d003649594)

* [List/array adverbs now use `Nil` instead of empty array.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b1f0fc0165a3967b7a0d080c53d70981eccd2a75)

#### Niecza Perl
* [`infix:<∖>` (set difference, not backslash) takes any number of arguments.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/a7a94cfc336619fba20badfb355b571d3d6e9586)

* [`infix:<∖>` (see above) returns `Bag` when first argument is `Baggy`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/a7a94cfc336619fba20badfb355b571d3d6e9586)

* [Implemented `.categorize`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/19355dd1450e8a21c41dc8322637084486f75efc)

* [Implemented `.classify`.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/7bae01243b6db66862902a759a93d42c8fdcb909)
