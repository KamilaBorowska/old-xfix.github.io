layout: post
title:  2.0

Unless you are viewing my website from [Planet Six](http://planetsix.perl.org/),
you most likely noticed I've refreshed the layout of this website. Well,
the reason why I decided to go with this update, is that [it's been a week
since first Perl&nbsp;6 changes article](http://glitchmr.github.io/perl-6-changes-2012W37.html).
It was exactly a year since I started Perl&nbsp;6 changes series.

The new layout introduces pagination, the feature I was too lazy to ever
implement. The pages were getting bigger, and it probably wasn't good
idea to send lots of content every time you visit this website. The
pagination controls are in the header, in case you want to check previous
pages. The first page would be page 0, it was like that by accident (off
by one error), but considering I'm a programmer, I'm going to consider
it a feature.

Also, in next days, there are plans to upload Perl&nbsp;6 articles, and
perhaps some other posts (after I will implement categories, that is, I'm
sure you wouldn't want to read these on Planet Six). Perl&nbsp;6 articles
are a nice filler, but I'm sure you would want to read other things.

The website is also mobile friendly, however, there are still few bugs
that I hope to fix soon. Not that previous wasn't, but previous depended
on bigger viewport. This website shouldn't depend on any certain viewport
size.

So, yeah, coming tomorrow, the article about `MAIN` subroutine, just to
avoid constantly writing the same articles. Enjoy.

Edit: [Nikolaj64](https://github.com/Nikolaj64) decided to improve my
layout (not that surprising, I'm not a designer). I'm sure it looks
better now. Thanks for help.
