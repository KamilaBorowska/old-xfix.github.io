title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W32
---
Most of improvements in this update involve threading and interop with
Java, and additional named parameters to `.squish` and `.uniq`.

### Potentially incompatible changes
#### Rakudo Perl
* [Internal methods are now dasherized.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8364f64833ec63c5543114e9d7867587c2cda256)

  It isn't really an incompatible change, considering the changed
  internal methods were added day after this article (`categorize_list`
  and `classify-list`).
  
### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* [`.squish` and `.uniq` now have `:as` named parameter.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/c313c2918ecdf5d72a0fa989670fed332d317d67)

  It allows you to specify things like "what you want to compare".

* [Added `samewith`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/a888b089ab07c39deb5b972270c01d76919ed100)

  It lets you rerun the function/method with different arguments.

#### Rakudo Perl
* [`.squish` and `.uniq` now have `:as` named parameter.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/59e521ecb2b5f799ba33cd9429b13528c5d98b08)

* [`.squish` and `.uniq` now have `:with` named parameter.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8d851b78317af7c5efddb788efa89b15a453c9b4)

  `:with` can be used to specify operator (or subroutine with two
  arguments) that compares whatever arguments are equal. While it's
  rather fast with `.squish`, it's best to avoid using it with `.uniq`
  as it has <var>O</var>(<var>n</var><sup>2</sup>) performance
  (assuming operator has <var>O</var>(1) performance, and <var>n</var>
  is number of array elements).
  
* [Optimizer isn't confused anymore by prototypes with optional parameters.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c2ef11587570222fa38b688d0c0285277cec5f76)

  With prototype like `($argument?)`, `$argument` can now be inlined.

* [Implemented compile time bind analysis on JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/fe0813a20182536dc6b42b372b5e12d48283c555)

* [Tabs in heredocs are properly dedented.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/33403622a6d20cf3b5936dbfd46037039bf1f4cb)

* [Optimizer inlines in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/fe419d2c615b297f0d9475e849d9923f0bfc7f36)

* [File name is now mentioned after `SORRY` line.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/156de3be59136b3b75f4eb51c7ee1697667a5cfe)

  This makes debugging easier, as you now know where syntax error
  happened.

* [Implemented basic Java interop in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d3b14a7458e1c421d2d447fea798512d99448ce3)

  You can write code like this.
  
      use java::lang::System:from<java>;
      say System.currentTimeMillis();

* [Implemented `:jar<>` for specifying JAR in `use`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/73b6583d9603754ed3b9ab0437e35c324a91130b)

* [`once` block now actually works.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/fe939bed52e555cb0cbefb4a911cf355b4461333)

* [Objects from Java are now `Any` and `Mu`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b4c8f67e1685e2f95f52d092aba0b4246988731b)

* [It's now possible to create codeless promise.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/572c45da3b6b9d9a27e39ab4670c2849174b2357)

  Such promise can be kept or broken from outside.

* [Implemented `Promise.sleep`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8ac6bb1d90b1f0c6f1980c5386c8fb641e17a7b2)

  It implements asynchronous sleep.

* [Implemented `anyof` and `allof` promise combinators.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/911796926615dc269c7a8ba706292ed0d2d7e3bf)

* [Added a basic Channel implementation.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/42758c1db5bae0065c38a64693e24c1aeee236ec)

  It works like channels from Go programming language.

* [`.of` works for scalar values.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/26f33e2e4afc8c1305a6f7784300da9bd9302782)

* [Impelemented `$variable.VAR.default`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/eea1906d6564555f5f27e13776429d7d614962e1)

* [`my variable is default` only assigns defaults when `variable` is scalar.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/1f57da5881e421615468981f349c8298d00c4164)

* [`is default` now works with hashes and arrays.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6edd19dd97527ee6942bfeca4a6d5670a63f2e71)

* [Added `.result` method to get broken promise cause.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6297ac572c60b2b3570a4eef0c42f381298a9095)

* [Implemented basic `IO::Async::File` class.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/495602ba21a3701e6b6c6abd713260849fcdd174)

  It can be used to asynchronously access files. As promises only exist
  in JVM, the implementation of it works only in JVM.
