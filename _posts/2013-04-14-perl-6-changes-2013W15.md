title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W15
---
I apologize I forgot about Perl 6 changes article yesterday. This ought
not to happen, but it did. As for reason why it happened, well, I guess
I will tell you anyway - it's [that game].

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* `Parcel`s are allowed to have 0 elements.

#### Rakudo Perl
* `.DUMP` method can detect recursion for hashes.
* Added `ForeignCode` for non-Perl 6 code objects (like C code).
* Removed lots of `pir::` usage for JVM port of Rakudo.
* Semicolon after keyword that takes a block, like `PRE ;` now has
  specific error message.
* Added `symlink` and `link`.
* `require` can take paths.

#### Niecza Perl
* Added special cases for `big_pow` when either of values is `-1`,
  `0`, or `1`.
