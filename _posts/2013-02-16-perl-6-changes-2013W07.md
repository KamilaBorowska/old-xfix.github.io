Normally, I wouldn't put irrelevant snippets of code<sup>[citation
needed]</sup>. But this day is different - we have Perl 6
equidieversary (thanks, [moritz]). It's 4596 days since Perl 6 was
announced (Wikipedia says it was annouced 2000-07-19, but actually
it was earlier). In 2000-07-19, Perl was 4596 days old. But I won't
discuss about this more, as [masak already made perfectly fine article about that].

Let's return to your regularly scheduled program.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* `Set`s and `Bag`s do not flatten in list context.
* Metaoperators are treated as normal operators, and aren't making
  list of closures. So, for example `@array X* *` is
  `-> $arg { @array X* $arg }.
* Inner classes and roles must be lexically scoped.
* Added `List.combinations` and `Set.combinations`.
* Added `Set.powerset`. It's defined like that.
      multi method powerset { set âˆ…, self.combinations }

#### Rakudo Perl
* `$_` is writable in `-n`/`-p` code (one-liner).
* `eqv` is faster for `Buf` objects.
* Configure script fails on unknown command line options.
