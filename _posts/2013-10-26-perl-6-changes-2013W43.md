New features
============

Perl 6 specification
--------------------
* [`is DEPRECATED` is now in the specification.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/b8106c90cbfa8dbea55404a21f6aacf5bbaeeee8)

STD.pm6
-------
* [Flip flops can be negated.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/8adbc60ac4bce2fda58c74017cb0cbc20d5fcbc0)

Rakudo Perl
-----------
* [nqp binary (for Parrot) is now called `nqp-p`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/54ffc91ba58f3d774963dc8c6ab4f086300a2712)

* [nqp binary (for JVM) is now called `nqp-j`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5df14829f255c3a3c1c03f5243e45bcdf87043e1)

* [Removed name collisions for `Makefile`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/07e119e1e779439a3f22ce9f082d8621044393aa)

  This allows you to use the same makefile for Parrot version of
  Rakudo, and JVM version of Rakudo.

* [Merged `Configure.pl` and `ConfigureJVM.pl` configuration scripts.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/499325e0fc33a151f664973a40a02c23462ba093)

* [Implemented `Parcel.rotate`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b0c90ed3d2f6a2c7b86ae21cea87940bfc5140f6)

* [Changed "Called proto of won't work" error messages.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/09336e3661a38d594112f8cb20b9c3ea0f28f59c)

  The error message "Calling proto of ... will never work with no
  arguments" is now "Calling proto of ... requires arguments".

* [`Parcel.reverse` returns a `Parcel`, not a `List`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/2684416fce76297ad97879a6926dcf611f077aaf)

* [`Configure.pl` now allows `--gen-nqp=branch`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/fe4e1ff34a01fa0c68b9ddc2cefc67ba3a61fe8a)

* [NQP is now built only when needed.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3c99ca750e2cb4df6c05b43ad0f6af4749561ccb)

* [It's now possible to use `is DEPRECATED` trait with classes.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/fd3e6833d7144e9b14fa28978168617fabfcf19c)

* [`Set.new<a>:exists` now works.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/882e3376c572cf34a3ffd5c82e5f4c6b0f348e17)

  And as expected, it returns `False`.

* [Updated Perl 6 grammar file.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/37acfa1d76ab7bf00716b8597aa81ea783c61499)

* [Put a guard against undefined code objects in backtraces.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c37dfc740e127dc6cc5ec42cd36555fab59f7120)

  Neither do I have idea why it's neccessary, but it somehow fixes
  a lot of specification tests.

* [Use of `is rw`/`is readonly` on private attributes now warns.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7378b2ae5131d5c364e0b6af58af1d6458aa2c2b)

  This is pointless as you cannot modify private attributes anyway.

* [Removed `LHF.markdown.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/73344a6edf2dc31f4b92dbb35bb4b588dc79f8cb)

  The file was very outdated, as it reffered to master branch, and
  asked to implement already implemented features.

* [Null regular expressions now throw compile time exceptions.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/493505cc64d6c562c8f811c0fd1dafac14d1e059)
