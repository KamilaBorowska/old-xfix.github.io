title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W02
---
I'm going to show another Perl 6 changes article. I'm so lazy, that
I really don't know what to put here, so I guess I'll now show the
list of new features.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* `-->` (return type) acts more like a normal subroutine parameter.
* Added `squish` method, working like `uniq` utility in UNIX - it
  only removes elements if it is duplicate of previous element.
* Adjusted precedence of set operators. 

#### STD.pm6
* Adjusted precedence of set operators.

#### Rakudo Perl
* Implemented `require ::($module) 'something'` syntax.
* `$socket.read($bytes)` now returns `$bytes` bytes, if possible.
  Previously it only read only 256 bytes.
* `$object.My::Role::method()` works correctly and uses correct
  `self`.
* `try` with `CATCH` returns `Nil` on exception, like it did without
  explicit `CATCH`.
* Failures in sink context won't throw if they were handled.
* `splice` supports whatever star (`*`).
* Adjusted precedence of set operators.
* `Junction.Str` now gives string, instead of junction with every
  element converted to the string.

#### Niecza Perl
* Adjusted precedence of set operators.
