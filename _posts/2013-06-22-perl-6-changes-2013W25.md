Perl&nbsp;6 makes you smile.

    niecza> '☹'.succ

Anyway, today, most of improvements involve JVM support in Rakudo Perl.
The JVM support progresses very quickly, as you can see in list below -
implementation passes initial sanity tests.

Every change mentioned here is in Rakudo 2013.06, called "Poznan"
(the name comes from city in Poland named Poznań).

### Incompatible change
#### Rakudo Perl
* [Rakudo soft fails when you divide by 0.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5faaf15c332ff6e5adc6520c52d76acd9e2f1208)

  Insert some picture of dividing by zero here.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* [`Z` metaoperator stops after the shorter list.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/a5592110238ade72f608124f30d97ac28d23c18b)

  This is how zip operator works in other programming languages, but
  it shouldn't be assumed it's obvious, so it was mentioned in the
  specification.

#### Rakudo Perl
* [Added `IO::Path.rename` and `IO::Path.chmod`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9fae045fa63841c37456d66f198068a80f54cb19)

* [`IO::Path.resolve` now throws proper `X::NYI`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/74ddcd4eedee227641edaab2a44ea289285854ec)

  Previously it threw soft error. It's not incompatible change, as
  depending on not implemented feature to be not implemented is just
  wrong.

* [Implemented `IO::Path.succ` and `IO::Path.pred`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0c78d26c03c67b50d8de89496b76a38d5b6a1e6a)

  These methods work [like with strings](http://doc.perl6.org/type/Str#succ),
  except returning `IO::Path` objects.

* [`gather`/`take` works in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ec48e7901d5e4cbb78460ff32a3a1652fa8faed8)

* [`return` works in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/583ca10710a693b8fa88627ee59986e3e5847dec)

* [Dot is allowed before hyper postfix.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/003f346cd0cba02bbb07dc4807febf1da6b96eaa)

* [Implemented sub signatures in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9599fcbc76231c651d24a411dd4bfe67437cd57d)

* [Many `Num` methods now work in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/e60cfbe69e21d69664a59b261da06d00cc2441bc)

  NQP on Parrot was fine with stuff like `nqp::add_n(1.2, 1)`. It's
  not the case with NQP running on JVM, which wants both arguments to
  have identical type.

* [Backtraces work in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/81060d1093b2fb52e713172cb2d04ffe392861ce)

* [`.succ` now works for characters "▁".."█"](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/af50a6ecfa31fe4dbd46bdfa5c0bd7874b344953)

      > print "▁".."█"
      ▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█

* [Modules work in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8839c5bd59dd7968b90b4c2100a0302c975cde86)

  They now temponarily use `nqp` methods, instead of unimplemented `IO`
  object.

* [Hashes can be iterated in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d6221ad88378525f7707f6f7e343dd3d84024889)

* [`$*VM` can recognize JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/949055e37086037730cfefd8eafe1537d252d0f8)

  Previously, Rakudo Perl put empty hash in JVM. Now, it can properly
  determine JVM.

* [Added `Cool.path`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5feb260a339a945409582faf9ac5191698ed0f42)

  While mostly pointless (converting integer to path doesn't make much
  sense,) it was added for consistency.

* [Implemented sequences between 1-codepoint strings.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f0ff25bb2c913faaa4822d9158a8851e336eb280)

  Now, you can safely do stuff like `join "", "\0".."\xFF"`.

* [Move global state into a `GlobalContext` extension.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/76f8db7c740b7d902473d350f27f5f2d035c302f)

* [`.perl` on `Rat` with 0 denominotaor no longer freezes.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0506d2a7bb88982722b7978258d8ae8dec77aee3)

  The algorithm determining whatever number can be writen as decimal
  number (to show nice number like `0.1` instead of `1/10`) failed in
  that case.

* [`IO::Path` uses `$!path` internally.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3c9027ad2aae9ec03ec68e6d865af217097979cb)

  This should make it faster, because it wouldn't have to concatenate
  everything everytime you do something.

* [Matching works in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c6980c9d90127962083e00d49e02f4156560c1c2)

* [Added `.exists` to `Capture`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/1767e8f6c62dc1bcfa03534775e4f66ea6e183b2)

* [Implemented `$!foo` parameters in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5913ce88214bb054bb93c029b9d699e6de577d4f)

* [Warnings aren't fatal in JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d221425e0752c5d04f567f434dce4eb1b498c7e3)

### Niecza Perl
* [Rewrited `infix:<∪>` and `infix:<∩>` to take arbitrary inputs.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/9f58f842d8542bd49e9cd7513d84551d6894e300)

* [Added `infix:<∖>` for set difference.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/cb6f20b6165d9852b971c8b7b063960637a4e490)

  Not to be confused with `\`, the capture operator. It's more like
  `\smallsetminus` operator in <span class="tex">T<sub>e</sub>X</span>.

* [Added `infix:<⊖>` for set symmetric difference.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/c53612142dacd916717de6d76a012f035b0b1283)

* [`infix:<⊍>` and `infix:<⊎>` take parcels.](https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/6672fa277de23930622191cd8410abe7a7b4f10f)
