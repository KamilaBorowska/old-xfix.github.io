title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W12
---
I really should optimize my blog layout, so empty intro wouldn't be
ugly. But I guess I'm too lazy to do it right now, so I have to explain
stuff. Every week, I list the list of changes in Perl 6 specifications,
and its implementations. That's just everything, boring, I know. Still,
it doesn't look that bad on Planet Six, so I guess I will continue to
make these articles :-).

This week, the Rakudo 2013.03 was released. Every change mentioned here
was implemented in it.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* Added `X::Range::InvalidArg`.

#### Rakudo Perl
* Removed lots of `pir::` usage.
* Multi dispatch is now implemented in NQP, not C.
* Released Rakudo 2013.03.
