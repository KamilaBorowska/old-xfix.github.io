title:  Perl 6 changes - 2013W18
---
Perl 6 gets more and more stable, less features are added, and the
features that are left are worked on. Also, Rakudo Perl is being ported
to JVM.

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* [Updated IO:: classes documentation pages.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/3acfeda8111674b72752bba03c9cbe02ded4c408)

  To many minor changes to describe, just follow the link.

* [Added `IO::Spec`, `IO::Path.cleanup`, and `IO::Path.resolve`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/2a92e084f167d7a76568b6c7aaffff6da572b140)

* [Flip flops now use smartmatch semantics instead of boolean semantics.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/6e2d9c944ca5b50cef9e23b15f130a626c1c2b9e)

  Now you can write code like `"BEGIN" ff "END"`, instead of using
  regexes for that.

#### STD.pm6
* [Use of & in infix position is now catched after whitespace.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/fa59c1b325a54b632447c1bcdb01a0e68b6bc0bd)

  Previously, code like `$some-object.some-method &sub-routine`
  appeared to work. However, it didn't meant what you would expect,
  it didn't called the method with subroutine argument, but assumed
  junction and. In order to avoid surprises, this is now disallowed.

* [The message about no parens or colon after method name is more specific.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/276a42f6c9602d25cd87518b0238876b6bce2f04)

  Now code like `$some-object.some-method 42` shows information that
  colon or parens are required.

* [Added lots of function declarations.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/291c7f08bd966544264332bb7c64f619f3a5cdca)

  The STD now recognizes certain functions that were added lately.

  * `is-prime`
  * `expmod`
  * `mkdir`
  * `rmdir`
  * `socket`
  * `listen`
  * `accept`
  * `connect`
  * `bind`
  * `infix:<leg>`
  * `infix:<cmp>`

* [Added `LoL` class and `X` role.](https://github.com/perl6/std/commit/b33d8e0b99931d59e6fe4fed81f6c05443ab9e68)

#### Rakudo Perl
* [Implemented `IO::Spec`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5b53365d8b774f94ccf371107e5c1544574bddcf)

  This class is intended to do OS-specific manipulation of pathes.
  It can get the localizations of special folders (for example home
  directory, root directory, temponary directory), and can manipulate
  pathes (by joining them, spliting them, converting them to absolute
  or relative, and so on).

* [Implemented `IO::Path::<os subclasses>`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/22397c5677aa89a0dbdb631aab98454049a41a6f)

  Thanks to this change, the pathes objects are OS specific. You can
  have path marked to be Windows path, so you can parse it in OS
  specific way, without having to use that OS.

* [Repeated `shift` is faster.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/08b640344cfd2de9a44afc313959a75c6568bcc5)

  On large arrays, `shift` is now noticeably faster. For example, if
  array `@a` has `50_000` elements, running following snippet of code
  is processed within 2.5 seconds (and not 9.0 seconds).

      @a.shift while @a;

* [Failed regex matches now return `Nil`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5edb1357bec9418a9b45d78c85290b59e3e0f821)

  Previously, failed regex matches were returning the `Match` object
  that stringified to `#<failed match>` and was converted to `False`.

* [`&diag` function in `Test.pm` accepts `Mu`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/80257434650c3fd8059df2d39916eee96f2dd19b)

  This, I think is self explanatory. `&diag` is a debugging function,
  outputing its argument. Forbidding `Mu` didn't made sense, so it's
  now allowed.

* [Exporting of subroutines now works properly.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c66c428cee75dcc28dcdf5140d6903105392d9d6)

  `use Module qw(sub1 sub2)` should now work.

* [Fixed `dir()` to work on Windows.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/02c7fbb8d716e9f1b8eb664d1340fc4b378858eb)

  This makes `panda` work on Windows.
