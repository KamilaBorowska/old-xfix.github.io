title:  Perl&nbsp;6 changes - 2013W34
---
This time, the Rakudo 2013.08 was released. All changes are already in
the released Rakudo.

### Potentially incompatible changes
#### Perl 6 specification
* [`My Dog $dog of Dog` is now disallowed.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/fac7a1ae9b6407749ef236d4f9510ef5d6ab8163)

* [You cannot directly write to `$/`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/33d795b82909ebf68676906de44d7320732601b1)

  This is designed to detect use of `$/` as input record separator.
  You can still write to `$/`, but not with standard `$/ = ...` syntax.
  Instead, you have to do something to not make it look like standard
  assignment, for example: using binding statement, or putting `$/`
  inside parenthesis.

* [`bless` doesn't have first candidate argument.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/de909c2d578b75871a14e59b260c446cd9a691fe)

  This is huge change, intended to make blessing easier. The candidate
  argument, that was usually `*` specified how to create the candidate.
  It's now responsibility of implementation. `BUILDALL` is gone too.

#### Rakudo Perl
* [Uppercase single letter placeholder variables are disallowed.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8e617d5881cf1682a120735a601f3dfd6e9c09f1)

  This avoids conflicts with Perl 5 magic variables (like `$^V`
  containing Perl 5 version).

### New features
#### Perl 6 specification
* [Implemented `visitdir`.](https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/96075285664785eceb1da4c735912bf55f8d24a6)

  It lets you visit the dir, and leave it when `visitdir` leaves the
  current scope.

#### Rakudo Perl
* [ConfigureJVM.pl shows it's actually ConfigureJVM.pl when using `--help`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/63a865aa435bc20d70b9a80cb8d9dc86d695263a)

* [Assigning `Nil` to default variable restores the default value.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/1964396953ef69c5014c7246db72633f7e721656)

* [`--gen-nqp` works for Rakudo for JVM.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3d594027fec9583b1b159efe7cb5a36a33ad8215)

* [`my %h is dynamic = a=>1; say %h<a>.VAR.dynamic` now works.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/47d2d7eebe3c47f2217c675bced7a4e69827472a)

* [`.VAR.dynamic` can be used directly on `Hash` / `Array`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9ecd99654ede05b2541cdfc231de1192022e995d)

* [`.VAR.of` now works.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/bc39ad2b35b0d13018b2c6be15063d170d0e2912)

* [You can run Perl 6 code in Perl 5 regexpes.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/da63d0841bba31dda1b2b518f87e1e24b72c5f15)

* [Typed arrays and hashes return proper `.WHAT` result.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/13f2f970c2913917d7126929e6591dc47c1ece3c)

* [`tr///` can now be parsed.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0ec828a8eb2af864742f9260da69bef0d0d87358)

* [Added `Syntax::Perl5Var` exception for Perl 5 variables, like `$$`.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/bda446566ac41af280f372c82d390a6f069c4e01)

* [`printf %d` supports big integer in Parrot.](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/44ba8ad0a4ae6f49060f2b7835408ef52a7cee2d)

  This previously only worked in JVM.
